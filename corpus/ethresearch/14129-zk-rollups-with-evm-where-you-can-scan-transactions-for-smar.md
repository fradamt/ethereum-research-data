# ZK-Rollups with EVM where you can scan transactions for smart contract content

Have any of the ZK-Rollup groups indicated any ability for public scanning of smart contracts in transactions on their rollup?

I hope I am explaining this correctly. Essentially I am looking for / interested in an Etherscan-type functionality for layer 2, so that a dApp could, for example, pull all transactions with a certain metadata tag. I guess it would also be similar to an NFT viewing app that looks for all ERC-721 tokens. I suppose a layer 2 where you could pull all ERC-721 tokens with certain metadata, because the metadata was publicly accessible and searchable.
