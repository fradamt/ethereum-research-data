**gcolvin** (2020-02-01):

At some point can we pull discussion back to these forums?  Or at least make occasional summaries here?  There is a huge amount of important discussion there that is difficult to catch up on, follow, or archive in a chat format.

**pipermerriam** (2020-02-02):

[@gcolvin](/u/gcolvin) yes, absolutely.  I recently made https://github.com/ethereum/stateless-ethereum-specs as a place for us to start building a common knowledge base and collaborate on specifications.  There isn’t anything there now, but I’m expecting us to start populating that repository sometime in the next 1-2 months.

I think this is a good topic for our next call.
