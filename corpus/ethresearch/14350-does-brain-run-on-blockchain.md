# Does brain run on blockchain?

Scientists have been doing MRI studies on how the brain makes decisions.

In the experiment, the participants had to make a free choice to click either left or right button on a keyboard.

Recently, we demonstrated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that the outcome of free decisions can be decoded from brain activity several seconds before reaching conscious awareness. Activity patterns in anterior frontopolar cortex...










What is interesting that fMRI shows how the neurons evolve from an initially undecided phase into the phase, where one of the two choices becomes dominant.

I think an intriguing question is, whether the neural network could run something like a binary consensus algorithm, where neurons start with conflicting selections and ultimately arrive at  consensus. The brain waves could then be interpreted as rounds in the consensus algorithm
