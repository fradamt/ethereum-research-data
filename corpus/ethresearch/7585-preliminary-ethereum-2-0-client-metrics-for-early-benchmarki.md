# Preliminary Ethereum 2.0 Client Metrics for Early Benchmarking

Hallo!

I’ve taken three ETH2 clients and synced them up with the Witti testnet while closely monitoring their performance metrics.

I’ve written a report that is available as PDF here:

preliminary, high-level eth2-client benchmarks










This repository also contains the raw data as well as scripts used to gather the data, and metadata necessary to potentially replay the test scenario.

I hope that someone will find this useful.

It renders all data points directly in the document. I didn’t want to reduce the details in the original document. Thanks for sharing a screenshot for preview.
