# How could I get the Uniswap (Pangolin) historical datas

Dear Researchers

I try to see the amount of liquidity provider’s injection and drains, swap(trade), marginal price and price  for each pool from start day to now. ( Uniswap or Pangolin)

How could I see these datas?

Other question is where these variables are coded in github?

Sincerely

Dr. Engin YILMAZ

You’ll need to either find a friendly archive node or stand up your own. From there you can run the Uniswap Subgraph against your node.
