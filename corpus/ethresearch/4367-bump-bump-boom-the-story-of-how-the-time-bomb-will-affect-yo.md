# Bump, Bump, Boom - The story of how the time bomb will affect you

Overheard Jay Rush working on predicting the Timebomb while at the Status Hackathon pre-Devcon. Ended up hacking on it with him, Ed Mazurek, and Lane. Since I didn’t have a project to present I made a presentation of the research we did, and thought you guys might enjoy it.

Cheers,

James
