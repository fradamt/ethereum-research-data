# ERC-2350 Semantic contracts (ERC extension - draft)

# Simple Summary

Store relevant infos on contract, in hexadecimal or hash to IPFS/other network file, instead of relying on individual data provided by different blockchain explorers.

# Motivation

Tokens already stores the most basic useful information: name, symbol, decimals. This data is used by APIs, services and blockchain explorers. But other information (site url, email, blog, social networks) depends to be updated on individual blockchain explorers. It gives more work to contract developers, instead of just focus on development. It also makes discrepancy between different services with contrasting infos which can mislead users.
