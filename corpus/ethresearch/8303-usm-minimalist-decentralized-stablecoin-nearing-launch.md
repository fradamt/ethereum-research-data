# USM "minimalist decentralized stablecoin" nearing launch

Just an update on the USM stablecoin project I’ve posted about here [twice](https://ethresear.ch/t/whats-the-simplest-possible-decentralized-stablecoin/7676) [before](https://ethresear.ch/t/update-on-the-usm-minimalist-stablecoin-two-new-features/7851): after a flurry of coding and refinements, this project is nearing launch.  The [code](https://github.com/usmfum/USM) is currently undergoing a security audit, and I’ve written a summary of the latest changes, mostly around 1. the oracle and 2. the “sliding-price” math: [USM “minimalist stablecoin” part 3: uh this is happening guys](https://jacob-eliosoff.medium.com/usm-minimalist-stablecoin-part-3-uh-this-is-happening-guys-b2ec5b732e4).

This is a volunteer-run, open-source, not-for-profit collaboration, and for better or worse the smart contract will be governance-free - no admin keys.  So would be great to get any feedback from y’all now!  Thanks, stay tuned.
