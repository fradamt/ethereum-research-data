# Suggestion for a new category: Security

Hello all. I develop and research automated security assessment tools to enhance smart contract security.

How about adding a security category in here?

I already know about the existence of a security community like [secureeth](https://discourse.secureth.org/) or [ethereum-magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/c/working-groups/security)

But I’d suggest security category for sharing the research idea and findings.

Thanks.
