# Early Rejection of Adversarial BALs

# Early Rejection of Adversarial BALs

> Special thanks to Ansgar, Marius, Francesco, Carl, Gotti, Maria and Jochem for their input and collaboration.

[EIP-7928](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7928) (Block-Level Access Lists, BALs) enables parallel execution and batch I/O for block validation by requiring builders to declare all state locations accessed during block execution, along with their state changes. This allows clients to prefetch state and execute transactions in parallel.

However, the current BAL spec could introduce a validation asymmetry that might be exploited to force unnecessary work during block validation. This doesn’t break execution parallelization, but it nullifies the benefit of batch I/O prefetching while still imposing significant bandwidth and execution cost.

> TL;DR: Invalid blocks might not be invalidated as fast as valid worst-case blocks can be validated. This prevents us from scaling. The problem can be mitigated by clients with a simple gas-budget check. A draft PR against the EIP can be found here.

To understand the issue and its solution, let’s start with how BALs work.

## Background: BAL Structure

A BAL is organized per account:

```auto
[address,
 storage_changes,   # slot → [(block_access_index, post_value)]
 storage_reads,     # [slot]
 balance_changes,
 nonce_changes,
 code_changes]
```

A BAL contains two distinct types of information:

1. Post-transaction state diffs — Writes are annotated with block_access_index, so we know exactly which transactions change a certain part of the state.
2. Post-block state locations — Reads (storage_reads and addresses with no *_changes) are not mapped to transaction indices. We know they’re accessed somewhere in the block, but not by which transaction.

**Why omit transaction indices for reads?** This saves bandwidth. When a transaction both reads and writes a storage slot, the write entry in storage_changes subsumes the read, avoiding duplication. Since parallelization only requires knowing which state locations are accessed (not when), the transaction index is unnecessary overhead.

This asymmetry is critical to understanding the vulnerability: writes can be validated early, but reads cannot.

## Block Validation with BALs

After receiving a block, clients use the BAL to:

- Parallelize transaction execution while delaying full BAL validation until after execution
- Prefetch required state via batch I/O to reduce disk latency
- Compute the post-state root in parallel with execution

> Before BALs, block validation was straightforward: the worst case was a block that simply consumed all available gas. You couldn’t make things worse by ignoring validity—clients would abort once the gas limit was hit and mark the block invalid. With BALs, this changes: we must ensure that the worst-case execution time of valid blocks is no worse than that of invalid ones.

### What Can Be Validated Early

**Post-transaction state diffs** can be enforced during transaction execution. Since writes are mapped to transaction indices, each transaction can be validated independently against its expected state changes.

[![Parallel validation pipeline with BALs](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/7/4/74dafbff70ba48c196da236ab723a2630356eb1d_2_690x313.png)Parallel validation pipeline with BALs941×427 47.7 KB](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/74dafbff70ba48c196da236ab723a2630356eb1d)

### What Cannot Be Validated Early

**Post-block state locations** cannot be validated during individual transaction execution.

A storage slot read by transaction x may be written by transaction y. When aggregating the final BAL, writes consume reads (the slot appears only in `storage_changes`, not `storage_reads`). Whether a slot ends up declared as a read depends on the complete set of writes across all transactions.

Therefore, validating declared reads requires executing all transactions first.

### Case Study: Geth

[Geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum), for example, uses multiple worker goroutines that execute transactions and validate their state diffs in parallel. For state locations (reads), validation is deferred to a `ResultHandler` goroutine that aggregates results after all transactions complete.

[![Deferred read validation in Geth](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/3/2/32ecead9c7ddf3262eda74284e63b8472524491b_2_690x464.png)Deferred read validation in Geth1014×682 58.8 KB](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/32ecead9c7ddf3262eda74284e63b8472524491b)

In practice:

- Workers execute transactions and validate state diffs independently
- Results stream to the ResultHandler which collects accessed storage slots
- Only after all transactions complete can the handler verify declared reads against actual accesses

This deferred validation creates the attack opportunity.

## The Attack

Now let’s examine what a malicious block builder could exploit.

### Setup

Let:

- G = block gas limit
- G_{\mathrm{tx}} = maximum per-transaction gas limit (≈ 2^{24} under EIP-7825)
- g_{\mathrm{sload}} = 2100 = minimum gas cost of a cold SLOAD

### Attack Construction

An adversarial proposer constructs a block in two steps:

**Step 1: Declare phantom storage reads**

Declare a set S of storage slots in `storage_reads`:

|S| = \left\lfloor \frac{G - G_{\mathrm{tx}}}{g_{\mathrm{sload}}} \right\rfloor

This is the **maximum** number of distinct cold storage reads that could fit into the block if all remaining gas (after reserving one max-gas transaction) were spent on `SLOADs`.

**Step 2: Include computation-only transactions**

Include one or more transactions whose execution satisfies:

- Gas usage ≈ G_{\mathrm{tx}}
- No accesses to any slot in S
- Pure computation (e.g., arithmetic loops, hashing)

The resulting BAL is syntactically valid and respects all gas bounds, yet the declared storage reads are never accessed during execution.

### Why This Is Problematic

Clients would start prefetching while executing transactions in parallel. From the perspective of any single transaction, they cannot invalidate the block before finishing executing *all* transactions.

The result: an invalid block that entirely deactivates useful I/O prefetching, bloats the BAL to hundreds of KiB (0.6 MiB at 60M block gas limit), and burdens the network — all while its invalidation happens too late in the process.

[![Adversarial BAL construction](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/8/c/8cd7c82e4d293f011a4931ecdb21bbf6e6f0f1cf_2_690x236.png)Adversarial BAL construction1228×421 39.8 KB](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/8cd7c82e4d293f011a4931ecdb21bbf6e6f0f1cf)

**This effectively means we cannot scale as much as the worst-case *valid* blocks would allow but we’re bounded by invalid blocks.**

> Why not just over-declare reads? If the attacker declared \left\lfloor \frac{G}{g_{\mathrm{sload}}} \right\rfloor storage slots (using the full gas budget), clients could invalidate the block as soon as any transaction wastes gas on operations that don’t access storage. But by leaving space for at least one max-size transaction, no single transaction can independently invalidate the block early.

Check out [BALrog](https://github.com/nerolation/balrog), a simple proxy for the Engine API that injects worst-case BALs into blocks, useful for testing.

## Solution: Gas-Budget Feasibility Check

The attack leverages two facts:

1. Individual threads don’t know what’s happening on other threads
2. State locations are only validatable after executing all transactions

However, we can exploit a key constraint: the **first access** to a storage slot costs **at least** the cold `SLOAD` cost (2100 gas, or 2000 gas with [EIP-2930](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) Access Lists, final value depends on [EIP-7981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7981)).

### The Invariant

Periodically during execution (e.g., every 8 transactions), the client verifies:

- How much gas has been used
- Which declared storage slots have been accessed
- How many declared reads remain

Then, let:

- R_{\mathrm{declared}} = number of declared state reads in the BAL
- R_{\mathrm{seen}} = number already accessed
- R_{\mathrm{remaining}} = R_{\mathrm{declared}} - R_{\mathrm{seen}}
- G_{\mathrm{remaining}} = remaining block gas

A necessary condition for BAL validity is:

G_{\mathrm{remaining}} \ge R_{\mathrm{remaining}} \cdot 2100

**If this inequality fails, the block can be rejected immediately.**

### Benefits

The gas-budget check delivers early rejection of malicious blocks after just a single max-gas transaction (~16M gas / ~1 second). Parallel execution remains unchanged, preserving all parallelization benefits. The BAL format requires no changes, and batch I/O is fully restored for valid blocks. Implementation complexity is minimal—just simple accounting in the existing result handler—with negligible performance overhead from periodic arithmetic checks.

### Alternatives Considered

An alternative approach is annotating read-only accesses with a first-access transaction index, which would make BALs self-describing and simplify validation logic. The gas-budget approach achieves similar early rejection properties but with additional accounting during execution rather than additional data in the BAL. Mapping indices to reads would add an average of 4% additional (compressed) data to the BAL.

Another alternative would be ordering the state locations in the BAL by the time their access occurs in the block. However, this would introduce additional complexity, as well as make it more difficult to prove things against the BAL.

The gas-budget feasibility check provides a simple, effective mitigation: by verifying that remaining gas can cover remaining declared reads, clients can reject malicious blocks early without changing the BAL format or sacrificing parallelization benefits.

### Sample ResultHandler Logic

```python
MIN_GAS_PER_READ = 2100  # cold SLOAD cost
CHECK_EVERY_N_TXS = 8

def result_handler(block, bal, tx_results_channel):

    # Count expected storage reads from the BAL (once, upfront)
    expected_reads = sum(
        len(acc.storage_reads) for acc in bal.accounts
    )

    accessed_slots = set()
    total_gas_used = 0

    for i, result in enumerate(tx_results_channel, start=1):
        # Merge this transaction's accessed slots
        accessed_slots.update(result.accessed_slots)
        total_gas_used += result.gas_used

        # Periodic feasibility check
        if i % CHECK_EVERY_N_TXS == 0:
            remaining_gas = block.gas_limit - total_gas_used
            unaccessed_reads = expected_reads - len(accessed_slots)
            min_gas_needed = unaccessed_reads * MIN_GAS_PER_READ

            if min_gas_needed > remaining_gas:
                raise Exception(
                    "BAL infeasible: "
                    f"{unaccessed_reads} reads need {min_gas_needed} gas, "
                    f"only {remaining_gas} left"
                )
```

That’s not technically true right? I mean, the fact that you can craft such BAL, doesn’t actually mean that you can do so in a sustained manner paying 60M gas/block for X consecutive blocks overbidding the priority fees of everyone else in the chain.

Still, the solution is so elegant and simple (yet to be seen if we can keep it performant (but it looks like it). That it definitely makes sense to go this way!

I think to make sure going the `gas-budget check` way is worth it, is important to make sure this process performs well and not even in the worst case blocks (not BALs) it doesn’t actually impact the performance/throughput significantly.

As IIUC, for a 4% bigger BAL (not block, though might just be the same in some worst cases as you said) being around 1MB would imply ~41KB. Which is not low. But it’s nothing compared to the orders of magnitude we are moving over.  Do you have any performance numbers on that? If not, any expectation at least?

Thanks a lot for the post. Definitely interesting and elegantly solved!

Yeah that’s true. One couldn’t sustain such an attack and thereby destabilize the chain because under ePBS you would still need to pay for the bid, even though your payload was invalid. Today, such an attack is basically free but it is easy for relays to check if they’re dealing with an invalid block or not (or have other measures like optimistic relaying).

The goal of the attacker would be to submit such a block to the proposer. The proposer publishes the block. Block is big, arrives late in the slot but before the PTC deadline, and takes long to execute. Next slot starts and the next proposer isn’t ready yet (hasn’t fully executed the block) - wat do? You either finish executing and you’re then late yourself or you reorg the block knowing it could be valid and that attesters voted for it. PTC says block is available.

This means, we can never scale futher than a worst-case execution block taking longer to execute than the time from the PTC deadline to the next slot.

Yeah good question, and agree. The size increase of it feels negligible.

While we’re adding multiples of 128 KiB on the CL we’re much more hesitant  when it comes to data on the EL. That’s the feeling I got too.

Having indices for reads would still improve the worst-case where the BAL entries are reversely ordered by when they are actually accessed in the slot (last account you need is first in the BAL). So yeah, we should get numbers on the efficiency gains unlocked by those 4% more data, and let’s see, you might be proven right.
