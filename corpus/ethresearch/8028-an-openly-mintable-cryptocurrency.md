# An openly mintable cryptocurrency

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share this short overview paper I posted yesterday on how to create an openly mintable cryptocurrency:

The main advantage in a system like this is that one will always be able to create their own currency units independent of network difficulty. However, the description written in that text is quite broad, and mainly focuses on the core flow of minting -> staking -> mining -> block proposal. But anyone with a background on how all the existing building blocks that used in the paper work can fit understand how the paper uses them to form the system.

I just wanted to get this out there to spark a conversation. I hope to be able to share more soon as the more detailed description becomes legible. If you have any feedback, it would be highly appreciated.

Thanks!
