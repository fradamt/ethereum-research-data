# Zero-Knowledge Proof API / SDK

Are you interested in zero-knowledge proofs? Do you want to implement it but you’re somehow stuck?

We’re building Zero-Knowledge Proof API / SDK, check our Github repo (work in progress)

https://github.com/zksdk/zkapi_mvp

We made available a limited version for personal use, if anyone interested in implementing it for commercial use or for a specific use-case, please feel free to contact us! Any feedback is welcome.

Hi,

How do you specify the things that you want to prove? And how do the two parties agree on what is being proven?

I’m curious as the codebase looks fairly lightweight at the moment and is lacking the zero-knowledge proof bits.
