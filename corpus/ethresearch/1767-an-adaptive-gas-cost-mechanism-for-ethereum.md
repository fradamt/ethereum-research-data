# An Adaptive Gas Cost Mechanism for Ethereum

[An Adaptive Gas Cost Mechanism for Ethereum to Defend Against Under-Priced DoS Attacks (pdf)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.06438.pdf).

Weirdly popular instructions become more expensive, and Shanghai-style attacks can be mitigated. That affects other users too, but they say that’s negligible (what’s the grief factor?). They use some cliff followed by a concave curve, but is that a reasonable thing to do? This is something for economists.
