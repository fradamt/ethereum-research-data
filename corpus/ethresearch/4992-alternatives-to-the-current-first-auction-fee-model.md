# Alternatives to the current first auction fee model

I’d love to start the discussion on replacing the current first auction based fee market we have for transactions. I think it has many inefficiencies and is also a major UX barrier for adoption. Perhaps first we can start by collecting all the valid proposals that are out there. The two I’ve seen so far are:

-Vitalik’s [proposal](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/original/2X/1/197884012ada193318b67c4b777441e4a1830f49.pdf) which introduces a real-time fix fee model based on how full blocks are

-A [proposal](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3318327) by some people at Cornell where users can bid for fees in a block but everyone ends up paying the lowest accepted fee.

I see the transition to Proof of Stake as a great opportunity to replace this model so I think getting some momentum behind it now would be good if the community can agree on a certain approach. We could leave the PoW chain as is.
