# How to apply for eth research grant?

I want to apply for ETH grant. Already sent them mail. Didn’t got any response as of now. Any forum to discuss more on it?

This is a belated reply, but based on experience and feedback with applying for a grant, the grant team wants to see significant progress before they can award a grant.

FYI there is a wiki [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Sharding-introduction-and-R&D) which includes others independently working on R&D.
