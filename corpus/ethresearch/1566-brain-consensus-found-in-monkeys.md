# Brain Consensus found in Monkeys

An interesting paper (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00313/full) discussing consensus of neurons in the brain.

A speculative suggestion is that we are all blockchains ! - the neurons of visual cortex run a masterless consensus algorithm like HoneyBadger or Algorand to agree on things.

BTW This explain laziness - when some neurons want to do something and some dont do it - a fork in neurons happens ![:slight_smile:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/slight_smile.png?v=9)
