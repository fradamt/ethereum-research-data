# Social Forking Options

Hey fellow ETH researchers,

Wrote an article on potential discouragement / social paths towards removing a large centralized validator or actor.  I go over all the options from ignoring attestations or sync committee messages to changes to affect fork choice rule.  Would love your thoughts and comments on which ones seem more plausible / you’d like expanded and tested.

As a side note, wanted to point out that to kill off most of these discouragement attacks, the proposer / validator split for rewards should just be 50/50. 1/8 vs 7/8 introduces a lot of problems in hyper competitive environments. Granted we want to use that issue here, but could be a real attack vector in a cartelized LST/ restaking world, reducing security across the board.
