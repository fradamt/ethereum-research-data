Great work!

The math behind this has obviously been settled for decades, but there are huge user experience and product development challenges in actually bringing something like this to people in such a way that people can use. The main challenge I see is that if people don’t use the application very much, then there is a high risk that >50% of a trust set will actually forget how to access their data; the main way to mitigate this that I can see is to tie the data they need to hold to something they need to care about for other reasons, possibly a cryptocurrency wallet. I definitely any efforts at trying to get past these obstacles; we need secret sharing utilities that are not just for hackers.
