# Deep technical debt audit methodologies

hard to categorize this, so flinging this to econ because everything’s econ, but was just curious if there’s ever been a deep dive into ethereum’s technical debt, up and down the stack – from cryptography to EVM and beyond.  thinking what a [methodology for doing a comprehensive technical debt audit](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf) might look like in the context of the ethereum stack.

with basic intuition that hidden debt compounds and is costly, dangerous, so on.

conversely, that mapping & paying down the debt improves maintainability, enables many more future improvements, etc.
