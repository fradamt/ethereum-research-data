# Handshake / Decentralized DNS Meetup @Devcon4

I’d like to get a Devcon4 Handshake / Decentralized DNS dinner/lunch get together going in Prague, for those of us hacking something on Handshake + Decentralized DNS.  You should have some HNS coins and a hacking plan in progress to contribute to decentralized DNS / decentralized web, where the goal is to coordinate open source ideas together (e.g. here is my [handshake.org](http://handshake.org) site, Plasma chain treating domains as NFTs, etc., but no name squatter type people please).  If there are more than 10 people voting I will post an Eventbrite link.

- November 1st 7pm-9pm dinner
- November 2nd 7pm-9pm dinner
- November 3rd 11am-1pm lunch
