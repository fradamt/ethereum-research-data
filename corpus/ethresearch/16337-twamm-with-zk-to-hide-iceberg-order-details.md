# Twamm with zk to hide iceberg order details

I have been researching on iceberg orders in Twamm for a month. I had an idea about what if we hide the icerberg order details using zero-knowledge so that no user would be able to use that data for market manipulation just like how binance does it but without going for off-chain solutions.

I just wanna know if this is a feasible model for hiding large trade transaction data.

This is feasible, and you can check that my post has already opened up the circom circuit for this feature.[The Application of ZK-SNARKs in Solidity - Privacy Transformation, Computational Optimization, and MEV Resistance](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-application-of-zk-snarks-in-solidity-privacy-transformation-computational-optimization-and-mev-resistance/17017)
