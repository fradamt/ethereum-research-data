# The Privacy Trilemma

[![image](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/optimized/3X/4/5/45111cb157ccb7759c661904caed67fbaa15e207_2_500x500.jpeg)image900×900 65.6 KB](https://ethresear.ch/uploads/default/45111cb157ccb7759c661904caed67fbaa15e207)

The trilemma says **you can only have two out of three**:

**Privacy** – this means the industry needs confidential data on-chain to match Web2 financial apps. Otherwise, we’ll be stuck forever with trading/gambling/HODLing use cases.

**Ease of use** – without ease of use and ease of development, no one will use or build privacy apps.

**Classic Consensus** – this refers to the classic PoS consensus.

If you use Classic Consensus, you can achieve privacy but **at the expense of being prohibitively hard to use**.

This is very much like Windows fixing security using anti-virus software vs Mac being secure at its foundation.

If you want privacy and ease of use, **you must embed privacy into consensus**.

Questions?))

Yeah, sure. ![:+1:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/+1.png?v=14)

FYI, this is how the [Mac vs. PC debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac) ended up back in 2008 circa:

- “Hi, I’m a Mac!”
- “And I’m a PC.”
- “… and we’re the same because we both use Chrome.”

Anyways, would you mind explaining why this is a trilemma please? In other words, why can we only get two out of three?
