# Smart contract development survey [research study]

Hi ethresearch folks, I’m posting here to seek volunteers for a research study we’re doing on developer experience. If you’ve programmed smart contracts before, you can earn $30 by participating in an hour long survey & live-code review session. Please see the invitation below:

`` We are a group of researchers at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and we are recruiting people who have experience with solidity smart contracts for a study that aims to better understand developers’ experience in developing smart contracts. The surveys and interview will take about an hour in which the researchers will ask questions about their security practices as well as there will be a code review task. There is a 30$ compensation for each participant. If you are interested, feel free to direct message me or email me at [tsharma6@illinois.edu](mailto:tsharma6@illinois.edu).

Fill out the short screening survey to help us identify if you are eligible to participate in this study.
