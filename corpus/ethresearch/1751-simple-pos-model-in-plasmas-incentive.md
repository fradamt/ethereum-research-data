# Simple PoS model in Plasma's incentive

1. Is there any incentive for a staker to make child block faster? (because everybody has its own bound?)
2. Is there any incentive for a staker to make additional block after it meets its quata? (e.g.  there exists 95 blocks, is there any incentive to prevent one(who has 5%) 's withholding? )
