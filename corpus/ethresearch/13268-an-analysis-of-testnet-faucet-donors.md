# An analysis of testnet faucet donors

Oh god, no idea how that made it in. I guess at least if the double counting is consistent, it shouldn’t affect the overall rankings. Also, thanks for the feedback on methodology, makes much more sense to subtract subsequent removals (although I suppose that’s not too common?)

Thanks for the wallets! I took a look, and it seems like I filtered them out because they don’t have any mainnet activity. Not sure how I should deal with this? And linking to their “main” address seems much to complicated/impossible.

Yeah, probably a very rare situation ![:smiley:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/smiley.png?v=12)

I’d show them on the ranking anyway, otherwise the biggest funders are missing.

Hmm, don’t know what to do with the NFT ![:man_shrugging:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/man_shrugging.png?v=12)
