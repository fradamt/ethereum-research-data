# Resilent multi-chain architecture

*TL;DR*

Usually in sharded or multi-chain architectures, a compromise of a single shard leads to a catastrophic event of the entire system.

In a world, where there are potentially millions of chains, a different approach is needed.

An architecture is described where a compromise of a single chain does not lead to a global compromise.

*Description.*

It is clear that the crypto world is becoming multi-chain and multi-project.

It is important that the compromise of a single chain or a single project does not lead to a global catastrophe.

Many sharded chains including earlier proposals for ETH2 had a property that a compromise of a single shard led to a global compromise.

If you compromised a single shard you could print an infinite amount of a particular token and move it to other shards.

When the number of shards/chains increases the complexity of a system grows and a compromise of a single chain becomes is almost inevitable.

Therefore, the system needs to survive if a particular chain or shard is compromised.

It turns out that the simplest way to do this is to follow the steps described below:

1. Each ERC or NFT token X is assigned OwnerChain
2. Only OwnerChain can mint the token X.
3. OwnerChain keeps track of token X balances on any other chain.
4. Only token transfers between OwnerChain and other chains are allowed.  Cross chain transfers are prohibited.

For example, if token X needs to be transferred from chain Y to chain Z,  it first goes from Y to OwnerChain and then from OwnerChain to Z.

This is done because OwnerChain needs to update token balances for chains X and Y.

It is clear from described above, that compromise of, say, chain Y does not lead to a global compromise of token X.  The damage is limited to the balance of X on Y.

Once the architecture described above is established, the blockchain world separates into three types of chains:

- DappChains : these are chains where dapps run.  Each DappChain will typically own a single token
- DefiChains: these are chains where defi applications, such as DEXes run.  Typically users will transfer tokens from DAppChains to DefiChains to exchange them for stablecoins such as USDC.
- finally, ConnectorChains can be used by external centralized entities to hold tokens. For instance, to exchange USDC into fiat you would transfer it to Binance ConnectorChain
