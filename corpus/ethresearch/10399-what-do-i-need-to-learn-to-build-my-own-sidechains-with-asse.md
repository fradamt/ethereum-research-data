# What do I need to learn to build my own sidechains with assets on mainchain?

I’ve built a very [clever DAO-Oracle smart contract](https://obelusvoto.medium.com/how-do-these-dao-oracles-work-db2dcd721b51).

I want to use the assets related to that contract to run a sidechain. But I have no idea where to start. I tried googling “how do build a sidechain” but it’s hard to grab on to something there.

“With that being known, now let’s ask ourselves who should have a vote for the greater good? The majority.”

Actually the minority of people who care.  The majority who does not care needs to learn to trust the abovementioned minority.

representatives

elected by vote

the oracle uses a delegate system. because it’d cost too much to pay for every holder to vote.

So what do you know about getting started with learning sidechains?

fixed.
