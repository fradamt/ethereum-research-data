# What is the most recent Casper FFG specification?

Hi, I’m looking for the most recent Casper FFB spec for Eth2.0.

On Eth2.0 [github pages](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs) there is noting about Casper.

The arxiv  paper: [Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09437) got some updates, but didn’t have time to analyze changes, so not sure if it’s just minor / style updates or the updates to the most recent spec.

Also, is [@vbuterin](/u/vbuterin)  [Casper Note](https://vitalik.ca/files/casper_note.html) still up-to-date?

All best.
