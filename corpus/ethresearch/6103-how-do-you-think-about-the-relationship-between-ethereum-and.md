# How do you think about the relationship between Ethereum and DeFi on Ethereum?

Hey Guys In recent days,I found something tricky:Defi is very popular now.And almost Defi application is deployed on the Ethereum.However,more and more Defi application showing up,Ethereum’s price and marketcap become lower.It is a very tricky phenomenon,because the data of defi is still stored on the ethereum mainnet.Remenber,miner pay some cost on data storage,but it seems there is not any value capture between Defi(or applicatiob)and ethereum mainnet.
