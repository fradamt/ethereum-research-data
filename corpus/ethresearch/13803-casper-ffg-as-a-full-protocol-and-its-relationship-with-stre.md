# Casper-FFG as a full protocol and its relationship with Streamlet

# Casper-FFG as a full protocol and its relationship with Streamlet

*Warning: this post does not really have “a point”. I just started wondering about the similarities of Casper-FFG and Streamlet, and while trying to understand how/why they were different, and if there was anything to learn from their difference, I ended up realizing they’re actually a lot more similar than it looks at first glance. Maybe someone which knows both protocols will find it interesting, others might find it interesting that along way Casper-FFG is specified as a complete protocol, everyone else should probably find something else to read.*

We consider a lightly modified version of Streamlet, and then change its voting rule, taking inspiration from Casper-FFG. One might consider the result to be a full specification (complete with round structure, leader selection and voting rules such that it is provably live) of Casper-FFG as an independent protocol (which can be used as a finality gadget or as a standalone consensus protocol). We then show that this protocol is in some sense equivalent to the modified Streamlet.

## Streamlet

Streamlet is an extremely simple protocol, with a barebone propose-vote structure. Given its simplicity, I’ll avoid any recap other than the protocol description directly from the [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/088.pdf).

## Modified Streamlet

The modifications are minimal. We slightly modify the voting rule, then just make some adjustements to preserve liveness and to take advantage of the new voting rule for faster finality.

**Voting rule**: we modify the Streamlet voting rule by adding a tie-breaking rule to pick between multiple longest notarized chains. The current voting rule is *“vote for a block if it extends one of the longest notarized chains”.* We modify it to:

*Vote for a block if it extends the longest notarized chain, with ties broken by latest notarization epoch of the tip*.

**View-merge**: To avoid breaking liveness (which we would, because the adversary can abuse the tie-breaking rule to split the votes of honest participants and keep collecting new private notarizations that win the tie-breaking rule, perpetuating the attack) we also introduce [view-merge](https://ethresear.ch/t/view-merge-as-a-replacement-for-proposer-boost/13739) to the protocol, so we add one round to each epoch and follow the usual view-merge construction, which I won’t describe here since it’s a generic technique (though its use here is *considerably* simpler, because all that needs to be synced is notarizations).

**Finality**: The new voting rule simplifies the finalization condition of Streamlet. In the original protocol, a block is finalized *if it is in the middle of three consecutive notarizations*. With tie-breaking by latest notarization epoch, the new finality condition is instead:

*A block is finalized if it is the first of two consecutive notarizations*.

### Slashing conditions

The voting rules imply these slashing conditions, the first two of which are exactly the slashing conditions of vanilla Streamlet:

- E_1: two votes for the same epoch (equivocation)
- E_2: two votes for conflicting blocks A, B such that |A| > |B| and ep_A = epoch(A)  |A'|: Here the notarization of A'  and A clearly break the voting rules (by which we mean, and will also later mean, that a vote to notarize A' and a vote to notarize A are slashable, so that both notarizations coexisting requires 1/3 slashable), in particular E_2.
- |A| \leq |A'|: let C be the descendant of A' such that |C| = |A| (possibly A' itself). If ep_C > ep_A, and thus also ep_C > ep_B, then the notarization of C and B violate E_2, since |B| > |C|. If instead ep_C  |A|. If not, we have ep_C  ep_A. Then the notarization of its tip violates E_2, because its parent is shorter than A.
- Case 2: height n in the conflicting chain is at an epoch  ep_B, we have a surround vote situation: the notarization of height n+1 in the conflicting chain violates E_3, because its parent is tied with A for length but A has later epoch.

### Liveness

View-merge and the modified voting rules combine to give us **reorg resilience**, i.e. the property that a honest proposal always stays in the canonical chain (again, given by the fork-choice implicitly determined by the voting rules), if proposed under synchrony. Reorg-resilience trivially gives us liveness under synchrony, because it implies that we only require two honest slots in a row in order to finalize, since we now that the honest proposal from the first slot will be notarized and it will be extended by the honest proposal in the following slot, which will also be notarized. The contribution of view-merge is that, under synchrony, it implies that a honest proposal is voted by all honest voters, and thus immediately notarized. Synchrony then also ensures that all honest voters know of the notarization before the next slot (or more precisely before freezing their view). At this point, we don’t need synchrony anymore. Crucially, all honest voters see the latest proposal as the tip of a longest notarization. This is because even a private notarization would have to have a parent who is publicly known to be notarized, so a honest proposal would always extend at least the penultimate block of any longest notarized chain, regardless of whether the tip of such a chain is publicly known to be notarized or not. The new honest notarization then wins the tie-breaking rule by being the latest notarization. While we don’t have accountable safety yet, because votes for a child of the latest proposal have not yet been cast, we already have safety, by exactly the same arguments as before: none of the honest voters will ever see any conflicting chain as winning the fork-choice and thus will never vote for something conflicting.

Note that vanilla Streamlet instead requires 4 honest slots in a row to finalize. The first one is required because of the lack of reorg-resilience, as a private notarization revelead by the adversary might waste the slot. The next three are required because the lack of a tie-breaking rule means that three notarizations in a row are required to finalize.

## Casper-FFG as a full protocol

We take the modified Streamlet from the previous section, and simply change the voting rule (and accordingly also the slashing rules) to this one:

*Vote for a block if it extends the chain with latest notarization epoch*.

Alternatively, and maybe a useful way to think about it for those with knowledge of Ethereum, one could again speak of the implicit fork-choice instead of the voting rule, and say that the *canonical chain is the one with latest notarization epoch* (there cannot be ties unless 1/3 has equivocated, so this is a well-defined rule). The voting rule then is simply *“vote for a block if it extends the head of the chain”*.

**Slashing rules**: The “usual” for Casper-FFG:

- E_1 (equivocation)
- E'_2: two votes for conflicting blocks B, D, with respective parents A, C,  such that ep_C < ep_A < ep_B < ep_D (surround voting)

**Finality**: same as in modified Streamlet, the first of two consecutive notarizations is finalized.

**Security**: It’s quite clear that accountable safety still follows from the same argument of Casper-FFG. Liveness follows essentially from the same argument made for modified Streamlet, using reorg-resilience. The argument is actually even simpler because there’s no need to argue about a honest notarization being the tip of a longest chain: being the latest notarization is all that is needed here. Regardless, we won’t need to make these arguments any more precise, because we are soon going to prove that modified Streamlet and this protocol are in some sense the same protocol.

Hopefully, the connection with Casper-FFG is clear to those with knowledge of it or Gasper. There’s no (source, target) votes, but the slashing rules still look *very* familiar, and the fork-choice and finality condition even more so once “notarization” is replaced with “justification”.  In fact, we implicitly do have (source, target) votes here and in modified Streamlet as well: the target is the block which is being voted, and the source is simply its notarized parent. The reason why this is implicit here, but explicit in Casper-FFG, is simply that Casper-FFG doesn’t have its own block-tree structure, and rather just works with the underlying structure that it provides finality to. In the finality gadget setting, the links would already be provided by its block tree structure: a Streamlet block would contain a checkpoint which it proposes to notarize/justify, the target, and the source would be the checkpoint contained by the parent of this block. Therefore, voting for a Streamlet block implies a (source, target) vote on the underlying structure, whereas just voting for a single block in the underlying structure does not. For example, in the first diagram below, voting for C does not imply a well-defined (source, target) vote (except if FFG information is also embedded in the chain, as is the case in Gasper), whereas voting for \gamma implicitly carries a (A, C) vote. In the second diagram, you can see how surround voting works in the two settings.

## Equivalence of the two protocols

We now argue that modified Streamlet is equivalent to the protocol from the previous section, which we’ll just refer to as Casper-FFG, in the following sense: if voting rules of modified Streamlet are followed, then the canonical chain identified by its implicit fork-choice always corresponds to that which is identified by the implicit fork-choice of Casper-FFG, and the same is true is the voting rules of Casper-FFG are followed (in both cases, meaning that we don’t have 1/3 slashable). In other words, using either set of voting rules is equivalent, because they identify the same canonical chain, and thus produce the same votes. Concretely, identifying the same canonical chain means that the longest chain with ties broken by latest notarization is always the latest notarized chain, or equivalently that the latest notarization is also the tip of a longest chain, unless 1/3 is slashable according to either set of slashing conditions. In fact, the slashing conditions are also equivalent, at least up to the first instance of conflicting finalized blocks.

### Fork-choice rules

Let’s start by showing that following the modified Streamlet voting rules leads to a canonical chain which is the same under either fork-choice, i.e. such that the latest notarized is also the tip of a longest chain. We do by induction. In particular, we show the following statement \forall n:

*Consider a block tree consisting of notarizations with maximum epoch \leq n, and such that < 1/3 of the participants have violated slashing conditions E_1 and E_2 by voting for these notarizations. Then, the block of latest epoch is also the tip of a longest chain.*

*Proof:*

At Genesis, this is true. Now, assume it holds up to n, and fix a block tree of notarizations up to epoch n, satisfying the assumptions. We now want to extend this with notarizations of epoch n+1. We only need to consider the case where we have a single notarization from epoch n+1, because it’s clear that the property still holds in the case where we don’t have any, and multiple notarizations from the same epoch requires a violation of E_1. Say block A is notarized at epoch n+1, and that B is the tip of a longest chain in the original block tree, without A. If |A| < |B|, then ep_B < ep_A means that the notarization of A violates E_2. Therefore, |A| \geq |B|, and so A is the tip of a longest chain in the new block tree. Moreover, it is the latest notarization in it, since it is the unique block of notarization epoch n+1, so the statement still holds.

We also show this corollary, which will be useful later:

*Corollary 1: Consider two notarized blocks A, B such that no notarizations of epoch \leq \max(ep_A, ep_B) violate E_1 and E_2, then A > B if and only if ep_A > ep_B*.

*Proof:*

Consider the block tree consisting of all notarizations of epoch \leq \max(ep_A, ep_B). Say ep_A > ep_B, so A is also the block of latest epoch in the tree. Applying the previous result, we know that A is also the tip of a longest chain, so also |A| \geq |B|, and thus A > B. Since A, B are symmetric, ep_A < ep_B implies B > A, so A > B if and only if ep_A > ep_B.

It might seem odd that the arguments do not involve E_3, but there is a simple reason for that, namely that a violation of E_3 would not compromise the property we are considering here. In fact, given A, B, C, D as in E_3, the notarization of D still leaves the two fork-choice rules in agreement if they were before. Therefore, the voting rules of vanilla Streamlet also produce a block tree in which the latest notarization corresponds to a longest chain. On the other hand, the votes themselves might differ from those of Casper-FFG (and modified Streamlet, which always correspond to them), because of not breaking ties in favor of the latest notarization.

*Consider a block tree consisting of notarizations with maximum epoch \leq n, and such that < 1/3 of the participants have violated slashing conditions E_1 and E'_2 by voting for these notarizations. Then, the block of latest epoch is also the tip of a longest chain.*

At Genesis, this is true. Now, assume it holds up to n, and fix a block tree of notarizations up to epoch n, satisfying the assumptions. We now want to extend this with notarizations of epoch n+1. We only need to consider the case where we have a single notarization from epoch n+1, because it’s clear that the property still holds in the case where we don’t have any, and multiple notarizations from the same epoch requires a violation of E_1. Say block A is notarized at epoch n+1, with parent C, and that B is the latest notarization in the original block tree, and has parent D. B being the latest notarization in the original block tree means that it is also the tip of a longest chain, by inductive assumption. If ep_C < ep_D, then ep_C < ep_D < ep_B < ep_A, so we have a surround vote violation. Therefore, ep_C > ep_D (equality would violate E_1). Now, consider the block tree obtained by removing all notarizations with epoch > ep_C from the current one. The inductive assumption applies to this block tree, so block C being the block of latest epoch in it implies that is also the tip of a longest chain. ep_C > ep_D implies D is also in the tree, so |D| \leq |C|. Finally, that implies |B| \leq |A| as well, so A is the tip of a longest chain in the block tree we considered, and also the block of latest epoch. The property still holds.

We repeat the corollary from before, but for the Casper-FFG setting, i.e. a block tree in which E'_2 is not violated, rather than E_2. The proof is identical, but using this last result.

*Corollary 2: Consider two notarized blocks A, B such that no notarizations of epoch \leq \max(ep_A, ep_B) violate E_1 and E'_2, then A > B if and only if ep_A > ep_B*.

### Slashing conditions

We now show that the slashing rules are also equivalent, also up to the first instance of a 1/3 violation. Since E_1 is shared by both protocols, we have to show that E_{23} is equivalent to E'_2. Concretely, we show that the first instance of a violation of E_{23} is also a violation of E'_2, and viceversa.

By first violation of E_{23}, we mean that we have notarizations C, D, with parents A, B such that ep_C < ep_D and A > B (therefore violating E_{23}), and moreover that ep_D is minimal for such a violation of E_{23}, i.e that the maximum epoch of the notarizations involved in the violation is minimal. If we consider the set of notarizations with epoch < ep_D, there can therefore not be any such violation. If there’s also no notarizations violating E_1, then, by Corollary 1, A > B implies e_A > e_B, and thus we have e_B < e_A < e_C < e_D, i.e. surround voting, a violation of E'_2.

Similarly, by first violation of E'_2 we mean that we have notarizations C,D with parents A,B and e_B < e_A < e_C < e_D (therefore violating E'_2), and moreover that ep_D is minimal for such a violation of E'_2. Again, we consider the set of notarizations with epoch < ep_D, and then there can not be any such violation. If there’s also no notarizations violating E_1, then, by Corollary 2, e_A > e_B implies A > B, and thus we have a violation of E_{23}.
