# Keeper for Ethereum transactions

Dear  ethresear.ch

I’ve been working with Ethereum infrastructure for years (dapps, smart-contracts, security).

Every single day, all these years I myself, my clients and my partners spend time finding an answer to the same repetitive question: “ What did happen to the transaction I sent?”.

So, I’ve developed a system for myself and my partner’s use. This system does:

- Keeps the transactions that were sent,
- Monitors the transactions,
- Displays statuses of the transactions and shows errors if any in a web interface.

I’m thinking to make access to this system public. So, now I’m checking my idea that the system can be interesting for many. I created a small website for data gathering. If you are interested, please leave your email address via the website
