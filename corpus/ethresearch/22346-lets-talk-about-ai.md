# Lets talk about AI

Hey!

The AI revolution is here — and we need:

- A bold vision for AI
- Something truly valuable to users, not just empty hype built around buzzwords like “blockchain” and “AI”

The first and most critical step is identifying a **real, significant user problem** that AI can solve.

In my view, **the problem is security**. We need to build a **self-defending blockchain** — a safe, welcoming environment for users that shuts out bad actors, including threats like North Korean hacks.

Once we identify **“self-defending blockchain”** as our goal, the next question is: *Can we build it using open-source AI?* The answer is a **resounding yes**.

### Two Critical Points of Defense in a Self-Defending Blockchain:

#### Point 1: Smart Contract Deployment

Valuable smart contracts are deployed **very rarely**. People usually deploy standards like ERC-20 or Uniswap once and then use them for years. That makes **contract deployment** a perfect time for the decentralized network to take time and significant computational power **analyze the smart contract and its source code using AI**.

The network can require developers to submit the **source code, test code, and test results**, ensuring the contract is properly tested.

The AI can then analyze the contract over several days and assign it a **security rating from 0 to 100**, or more intuitively: **green, yellow, or red**.

Similarly, **user addresses** can be rated for security based on factors like account age, transaction history, prior interactions, and fund flows.

#### Point 2: Smart Contract Execution

Typically, users submit transactions through wallets like Metamask — either to a smart contract or directly to another address.

Here, **AI will require a human-readable description** of the transaction, explaining what it does. The AI will **pre-execute the transaction** and engage the user in a real-time conversation, ensuring the user **truly understands what the transaction does**, where funds are going, and what risks are involved.

This conversation will use the **contract security analysis** from Point 1.

### Where Does the AI Run?

**a)** Community can develop **base models** for Points 1 and 2.

These models must be fast enough to run on **ETH nodes**. For contract deployment, longer runtimes (days) are acceptable. Each AI inference must be **replicated on multiple randomly chosen nodes**, and a **2/3 supermajority** will determine the consensus result.

**b)** For more advanced analysis, the network can introduce an **open auction model**, allowing **anyone in the world** to participate in the evaluation.

The contract or transaction submitter can **choose to pay** for the best answers, selected by them. High-value use cases will naturally opt for **higher-quality models**, even at a premium.

### Summary: MVP for Self-Defending AI

1. Security analysis at smart contract submission
2. Conversational AI at transaction submission — using the analysis to help users understand and avoid malicious actions

These two components must be **compatible with Ethereum ecosystem tools and APIs** to provide seamless, AI-enhanced protection.
