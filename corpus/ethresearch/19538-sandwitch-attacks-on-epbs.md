# Sandwitch attacks on ePBS

In this quick note we analyze the special case of ex-anti and sandwitch attacks on ePBS vs the current implementation. We show that with the proposed values for proposer and builder’s boosts as in [Payload boosts in ePBS](https://ethresear.ch/t/payload-boosts-in-epbs/18769) the situation is actually an improvement over the status quo.

This short note contains the raw numbers and it’s meant to be a quick update, no fancy diagrams, for such I recommend looking at the design notes in [ePBS specification notes - HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@potuz/rJ9GCnT1C) or even the forkchoice implementation notes in [ePBS Forkchoice annotated spec - HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@potuz/SJdXM43x0)

## Ex-anti reorgs, the need for proposer boost

The classical 1-slot ex-anti reorg goes like this. The proposer of slot `N` plans to reorg the block of `N+1`. For this they withhold their block during their time. After the proposer of `N+1` reveals his block (based on `N-1`) the attacker reveals their block `N` together with \beta attestations for it. The attack is succesful if

 \beta > PB .

Which in the current situation makes us resilient to these attacks up to a 40% adversary.

## Ex anti on ePBS

On ePBS the situation for an ex-anti attack changes due to the (block, slot) voting nature of fork choice. The attack goes as follows.

- Since the proposer of N wants to get their payload included, they can’t simply reveal their block after N+1 does. They have to have a timely payload so that the PTC votes for it.
- They therefore reveal their consensus block targeting a split view of the attesters at 1/4 of a slot. 1-x of the committee votes for N-1, as they didn’t see the block on time, and x - \beta vote for N (the adversary withholds their attestations).
- The builder of N reveals on time and the PTC attests to the builder’s presence.
- The proposer of N+1 will reveal a block based on N-1 only if
 1 - 2x > RB - \beta
where RB is the reveal boost that the builder of N received.
- The attacker now reveals their attestations for N.

The attack is successful if  RB > PB + 1 - 2x But given the above inequality this implies RB > PB + RB - \beta. Therefore we obtain as in the current status quo \beta > PB.

Since in ePBS the proposer boost PB is set to 20%. One is inclined to think that we have ex-anti reorg protections only up to 20%, a considerable downgrade from the current implementation. But notice that **the payload of N+1 is not reorged**. In fact, the builder of N+1 will not reveal their block since the head is N when the attack is successful, and because of the *builder withholding safety*, their bid payment will not be necessary. In fact, in order to reorg the payload as well in ePBS, we would require a sandwich attack.

## Sandwich attacks the classical case

A sandwich attack is very similar to an ex-anti one, but now the adversary is proposing slots N and N+2 and plans to reorg the block N. Their setup is just as in the ex-anti attack: they reveal the block N late, together with \beta attestations for it. Block `N+1` is early and receives 1 - \beta attestations (the attacker votes for `N` during N+1. The attacker then reveals N+2 based on N, obtaining proposer boost and attempting to reorg N+1. The attack is successful if

2 \beta + PB > 1 - \beta \Leftrightarrow 3\beta > 1 - PB

From where with the current values we obtain protection against this attack against validators up to \beta = 20\%.

## Sandwich attack in ePBS

In ePBS the sandwich attack starts also as an ex-anti setup. In particular, to get the proposer of N+1 to base their block on N-1, the setup requires

 1 - 2x > RB - \beta

as above. The consensus block of N+1 receives 1 - \beta votes just as in the current implementation, and the builder of N+1 reveals timely obtaining a builder’s boost: this is the main difference, **the builder’s boost makes this sandwich attack much more difficult**.

The attacker then reveals their N+2 block based on N. Obtaining proposer boost. The attacker’s branch then has weight PB + \beta + x. While the canonical branch has weight RB + 1 - \beta + 1 - x. The attack is successful then if

 PB + 2\beta > RB + 1 + (1 - 2x)

Which according to the inequality above implies PB + 2 \beta > 2RB + 1 - \beta, from where

\beta > \frac{2RB +  1 - PB}{3}

Which with the proposed values of RB = 40% and PB = 20% gives protection against this attack by an attacker up to 50%, a significant improvement over the current situation.

Multiple slot post-anti reorgs become worse in ePB. To give some numbers, in the current implementation we are resistant to 60% attackers for 1 slot post-anti reorgs and 53% for 2 slots post-anti-reorgs. On ePBS these numbers become 40% and 37%.

For more context, dropping the original note considering all the different attacks mentioned (ex ante, sandwich, balancing) that led to choosing the proposer boost value of 40%: [Proposer Boost considerations - HackMD](https://notes.ethereum.org/@casparschwa/H1T0k7b85)

Thanks, a more complete list of all attacks and careful considerations of those in the 1-slot case are  in the two documents linked in the first section
