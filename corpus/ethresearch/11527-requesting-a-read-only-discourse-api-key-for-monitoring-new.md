# Requesting a read-only Discourse API key for monitoring new protocol upgrade discussions

Hello, I’m representing the Stakefish Validator Group and we’re building an internal api (that we plan to open source) with the goal of having an up-to-date list of protocol upgrade discussions for the Ethereum ecosystem. The goal is to be able to participate in these discussion early enough that we might participate in them before they go to off-chain “vote”. Without a tool like the one we’re building, we’re forced to manually check the relevant forum categories every day.

Is there someone I could DM about this?

Thanks,

Teddy Knox

did you build this already? It could help us at Gitcoin too.
