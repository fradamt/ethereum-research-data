# PoC Implementation of Plasma EVM

The PoC implementation of [Plasma EVM](https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-evm-state-enforceable-construction/3025) is started in [Onther-Tech/plasma-evm](https://github.com/Onther-Tech/plasma-evm) and [Onther-Tech/plasma-evm-contracts](https://github.com/Onther-Tech/plasma-evm-contracts). Current implementation progress are as below.

- [x] Make enter / exit requests
- [x] Submit NRBs / ORBs
- [x] Finalize block and requests
- [ ] Challenge on Null Address Transaction in NRBs

Implementing TrueBit’s verification game is under research as well as challenges that requires verification game.

The next primary goal is research on computational challenge, especially verification game and SolEVM.
