# Perp dex liquidity

As you maybe aware that dydx had a recent loss of about 10 million dollars due to $yfi price spiked and dumped.

it happened on every exchange whether it was defi or cefi , but dydx took a big hit and started a bounty for the person who did it.

I think it is unethical for dydx to take legal action , if someone places a big market order for buy and it makes the short liquidate - you should not take legal action about the trader who profited.

after all the markets react to amount of buys and sells.

Agreed.

Bringing CeFi models to DeFi is never a good idea.
