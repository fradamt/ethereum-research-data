# Succinct quantum-secure signature scheme

**Background**

Quantum-secure (asymmetric) signature schemes have 1kB+ signature sizes. The public keys also tend to be large. Wikipedia has a [size comparision table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography#Comparison) for various signature schemes.

Below we combine sequential PoW with a symmetric signature scheme to yield a succinct quantum-secure asymmetric signature scheme. The private and public keys are 32 bytes, and the signature is 64 bytes.

**Construction**

Let `e` be 32 bytes of entropy acting as a private key. Let `H(e)` be the corresponding public key. Let `t` be a transaction with sender `H(e)`.

The signer first produces a proof `p` of sequential work for `[t, e]`. For example `p = H^n([t, e])` for some pre-specified large `n`. The signature for `t` is then `[e, p]`. Only the first (as recorded by the blockchain) signed transaction revealing `e` with a correct `p` counts as having a valid signature.

The PoW parameter `n` is a security parameter large enough to prevent front-running of the symmetric private key `e` on a different transaction `t'`.
