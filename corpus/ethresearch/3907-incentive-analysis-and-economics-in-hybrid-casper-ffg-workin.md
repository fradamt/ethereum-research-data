# Incentive analysis and economics in 'Hybrid' Casper FFG (working paper)

Here is a link to a joint paper with Vitalik and Georgios Piliouras about incentives in Casper FFG. The analysis is focused around the earlier PoS/PoW hybrid but we expect most of the analysis to carry forward to the pure PoS version and we are moving forward with the analysis of that protocol as well.

In the mean time, please take a look at the current draft and we are looking forward to any comments, questions or suggestions that you may have.
