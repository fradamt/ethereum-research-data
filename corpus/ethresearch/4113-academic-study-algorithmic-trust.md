# Academic study: Algorithmic trust

[MSc study about early adopters (i.e. users) of dApps/DLT networks in an institutional theory setting:](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yAiqIhswPElRpI7IQlNileqnI3oj6fAe)

- theoretical introduction of the concept of ‘algorithmic trust’ and embedding in relevant theory
- 288 unique survey responses from 46 different countries
- multiple theoretically derived proxy measurements were assessed in an Exploratory Factor Analysis for a data-driven approach
- study results:
- ‘algorithmic trust’ as an alternative to institutional trust and thus as an alternative paradigm of organising society
- survey participants using DLT solutions were not driven by monetary rewards, but a shared ideology
- confidence in security of DLT is correlated with IT prowess (relatedly, IT skills as major barrier for further adoption of DLT)

I wanted to share this with you as I think the results are kinda cool - if you got any questions I am happy to provide further input.

PS: I’m also not sure if this is the best place to post this, or if there is even some interest for less tangible studies like this. If so, however, happy reading!
