# Build on layer 2 or wait for eth to scale?

All my profits for my smart contract project currently go to miners in gas…

Do I adopt layer 2 and all profits go somewhere else?

Or do i wait for ethereum to scale to the TPS of layer 2?

and put in the FAQ: Problems? contact @vitalikbuterin on twitter?

Depends what application! If it’s token transfers, build on zkrollup today. If it’s more complex, build as a regular ethereum application, and you’ll be able to move onto a rollup without any extra effort when rollups come out.
