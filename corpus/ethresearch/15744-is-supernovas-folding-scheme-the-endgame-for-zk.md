# Is SuperNova's Folding Scheme the Endgame for ZK?

**SuperNova** is a new recursive proof system for incrementally producing succinct proofs of the correct execution of programs on a stateful machine with a particular instruction set.

These seem to be fantastic features. This article will mainly interpret how these features are implemented.

1. What is folding?
2. Represent computation with R1CS
3. Nova: NIVC for a single instruction
4. SuperNova: NIVC for multiple instructions(ZKVM)
5. Different with other Recursion
