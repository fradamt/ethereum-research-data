# Minimum gas oracle transactions? Or double transactions?

I am providing oracle results to my own smart contract..

What is the best way to pay minimum gas?

Say for example I needed a number between 00 and 99..

Could I have 100 ethereum address’ relating to those number.. That interact with the chain when I want to provide each number?

Or by doing something like:

Staking/unstaking dai to receive interest while also paying for the gas for the oracle..

Let’s get creative ![:smiley:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/smiley.png?v=14)
