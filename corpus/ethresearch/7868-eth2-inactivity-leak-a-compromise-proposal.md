# ETH2 inactivity leak: a compromise proposal

Looks like many people are scared by the ETH2 inactivity leak.

Here is a simple  compromise proposal (actuallu two!):

1. Keep the leak, but instead of burning the money,  unstake it (transfer it to a separate account belonging to the same validator)
2. Introduce two times - leak time and burn time.  Keep the leak time to two weeks (or make it even shorter) .  Make burn time much longer.
