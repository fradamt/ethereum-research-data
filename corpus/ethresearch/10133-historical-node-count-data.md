# Historical Node Count Data

Hello researchers,

I am looking to put together a basic Metcalf’s Law visualization (market cap vs # of nodes squared), but I cannot find historical data for node count. [EtherNodes](https://ethernodes.org/history) has the data in a chart, but not in a usable format (CSV, JSON, etc.). Does anyone know where I can find historical node count data? Or somehow pull the data from EtherNodes.

Thanks!
