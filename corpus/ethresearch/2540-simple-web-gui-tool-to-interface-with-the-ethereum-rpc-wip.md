# Simple web GUI tool to interface with the Ethereum RPC (WIP)

Greetings,

Please find at https://github.com/grx9z/guirpc a very minimalistic HTML5/js GUI tool to connect to the RPC interface.

It connects to localhost:8454 by default.  You may need to get a local clone of the repo to get it to work.

This tool is a WIP that will probably not be developed further, so happy forking!

Recommend hosting it somewhere and pointing at some public node (like Infura).  Alternatively, at least post some screenshots or something so we can get an idea of what it is without having to clone it.
