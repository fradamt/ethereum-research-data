# Naming conventions

I thought I’d bring this up as an opportunity to rename some of the conventions that we have that may be improved on. Any thoughts would be great for any of the current but there are 2 that Id like to address.

Fork

This often refers to changes where the protocol concensus changes where backward compatibility is possible where for hard they are not. I propose for generations to be used for hard forks. Forks will remain where another chain happens from the main.

Wallet

Wallets hold funds. Not keys. Keychains hold keys. I propose we move to keychains holding keys.
