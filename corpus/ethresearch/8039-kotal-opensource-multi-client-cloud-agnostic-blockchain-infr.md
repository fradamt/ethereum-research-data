# Kotal - opensource multi-client cloud-agnostic Blockchain infrastructure delpoyer

Hi Everyone,

**TL;DR**

We’re building an opensource multi-client cloud-agnostic Blockchain infrastructure deployer to **solve the client-diversity issue** by helping node operators run client-diverse self-managing self-healing networks with little Ops knowledge.

Currently we’re working on Ethereum 2.0 Client ![:rainbow:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/rainbow.png?v=14) Teku, Nimbus, Prysm, and Lighthouse.
