# Miner strategies for edge in network propagation?

Hey all, I’m a masters in CS student at JHU and would love to be involved with research.

Question - has there been any analysis/literature done for miner strategies such as running multiple “propagation nodes” for self-mined blocks, to reduce the chance of creating orphaned blocks?

Motivation: Currently studying network dynamics through a research project. Other ideas could be studying the relationship between quality of adjacency graph (minimum number of edges between partitions, for all partitions in graph) and propagation/consensus

Appreciate the read and any leads!
