# Casper: Validator Yield as a function of TD and Issuance

[Link to Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14PLh7wLPaWopEJ8DIClo1SS42fN_0-qigtgtdACUez0/edit#gid=0)

This spreadsheet has various assumptions around ETH supply & issuance levels, validator required returns, total deposits, and how it ultimately affects validator yield.

It’s a model we will use to simulate various monetary policy and mechanism design decisions we will make. (Follow the boxed cells and notes for some hints.)

At some point, we will prepare a presentation that describes this model in more detail (and in a way that is easier to follow). But in the meanwhile, feedback and comments welcome! ![:unicorn:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/unicorn.png?v=14)
