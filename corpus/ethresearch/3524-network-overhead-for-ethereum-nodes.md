# Network Overhead for Ethereum Nodes

Hey Everyone,

I was looking for some statistics on the network overhead for individual nodes on the Ethereum network and couldn’t find any info outside of the latency info on [ethstats.net](http://ethstats.net). By that, I mean any information on how many individual messages and or how many megabytes a node on the network receives/sends/relays on average per day. Are there any existing metrics for this, and are there any predictions/estimations for such metrics under PoS/Sharding?

You could try using metrics with Geth?  This would be “subjective” to the monitored node though.

I am unsure how you capture the data for further use sorry.
