# Implementing Casper

Hi all, congrats on the release of the testnet this past week.

I’m aware of a project that would like to implement the current build and was curious to know who could help troubleshoot and Q/A the implementation?

That’s usually Karl Floersch.  But I don’t want to volunteer him.  I suggeste waiting until we finish our Casper testnet.
