# Where is the Alt mempool?

Looks like the only way currently available is to connect to advertised Bundlers and send userops to them, and there appears to be NO way where we can post userOps and allow Bundlers to compete and pick up. The ERC 4337 talks about Alt mempool. Is the design / implementation of alt mempool is planned? What are the challenges?
