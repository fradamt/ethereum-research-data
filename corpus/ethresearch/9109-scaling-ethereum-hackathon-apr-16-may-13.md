# Scaling Ethereum Hackathon (Apr 16 -> May 13)

Hey everyone, just wanted to surface that at ETHGlobal we’re running [Scaling Ethereum](http://scaling.ethglobal.co/) which is a 3-week hackathon focused entirely around blockchain scaling: rollups, channels, zero knowledge scaling strategies, and ETH 2.0.

For anyone interested in these things, I’d really encourage you to consider signing up as it’s an opportunity to contribute to this research, build infrastructure around it, try out the latest projects’ SDKs and offerings, and potentially win prizes or bounties at the same time.

Thanks ![:pray:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/pray.png?v=9)
