# Ethereum Scalability using Federated Learning/ Distributed Machine Learning

Hello my masters project is based of Ethereum scalability and for that I have to simulate the already available solutions at least (2)  and then work on my solution.

People who have already worked on it and can guide. Please looking forward to it. Thanks.
