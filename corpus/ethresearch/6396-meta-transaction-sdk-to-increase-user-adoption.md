# Meta transaction SDK to increase user adoption

We [@Biconomy](https://biconomy.io) have been working on improving the user experience for DApps. We have started out by building a meta-transaction SDK called MEXA that allows DApp developers to pay the transaction fees on behalf of its users. Try out the [DEMO](https://bookreads.biconomy.io).

To integrate MEXA no changes are needed in smart contract code. Mexa can be easily imported from npm and integrated in few lines of code in your client code.

**Currently we are live in alpha stage and looking for feedback from developers for our SDK ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=14)** Relevant links that will help you get started are mentioned below.
