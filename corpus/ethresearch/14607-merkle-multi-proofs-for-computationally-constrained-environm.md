# Merkle multi proofs for computationally constrained environments

In this research article, I present a highly efficient algorithm for verifying merkle multi proofs in computationally constrained environments.

Merkle multi proofs enable more efficient merkle proofs by re-using the intermediate nodes shared by the proof leaves during the recalculation of the root hash of the tree.
