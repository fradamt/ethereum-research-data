# Ola: A ZKVM-based, High-performance and Privacy-focusedLayer2 platform

We are thrilled to announce the release of the second edition of our technical white paper. Ola’s objective is to create a Layer 2 platform that combines privacy, high performance, and programmability. In this updated edition of the white paper, you will discover the design and construction of a high-performance ZKVM, known as OlaVM; the development of a Zero-Knowledge-friendly smart contract language, Ola-lang; and the privacy design architecture.

Details can be found [here](https://github.com/Sin7Y/olavm-whitepaper-v2/blob/15b8d489764dea69b92ff3aa29c3e4b6acb92a8d/Ola%20-%20A%20ZKVM-based%2C%20High-performance%2C%20and%20Privacy-focused%20Layer2%20platform.pdf).

Any comments or suggestions are welcome!
