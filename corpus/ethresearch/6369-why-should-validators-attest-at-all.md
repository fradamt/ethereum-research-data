# Why should validators attest at all?

I am reading ETH 2.0 spec, and one question I have is, why should validators participate in attestation at all?

The spec does not seem to specify any financial incentive at all for attesting blocks.

Block proposers do get paid block fee, but how are the attesters paid?

They get a reward if their attestations get included in blocks.
