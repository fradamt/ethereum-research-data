# Could Ethereum work for activity-shares economies?

If a system needs numerous highly differentiated tokens that are specific to their source economic activities, and units are frequently annulled as their related supply-demand loops close, could Ethereum support this type of dynamics, and to what scale and velocity?

The concept is explained more in this 4 minute video: https://youtu.be/Ueqqx8NJc2g

All the details are at https://activityshares.net/

The naive approach it to issue each from its own blockchain, but maybe the differentiation and burning can be done over one unified blockchain through contracts?

Thanks a lot
