# Improving the DAO/DAICO: questions addressed by our DAO3 proposal: Is it wrong to require a vote to get a refund, and wrong to force refunds by vote? Is it inefficient to burn instead of freeze tokens in a DAO3?

Hi all. We’re trying to come up with ways to improve DAO and DAICO structures. Full disclosure, we’re an ICO project ourselves. This, we think, gives us some view into what might be needed from both sides of the aisle. Thanks for your consideration of the DAO3 article here: https://medium.com/@cotrader.com/the-future-of-companies-onchain-dao3-will-exponentially-accelerate-the-creative-process-541337ce36ef

Should you like to comment about it on Twitter, it’s here below. https://twitter.com/cotrader_com/status/1045516095644454912

We’d really like to get some feedback about it. Thanks again!

Context is needed. As someone who is very familiar with DAICO concept and implementations I have no idea what’s this post about. Please elaborate. Thanks.

This looks more like ICO marketing

Hi, check the article linked in the tweet please. It explains everything. It is ICO marketing about how ICOs can be made better in the future, using this DAICO3 / DAO3 structure.
