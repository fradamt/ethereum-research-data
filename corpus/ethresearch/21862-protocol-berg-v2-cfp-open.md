The second edition of [Protocol Berg](https://protocol.berlin) (v2) in June is fast approaching. Therefore, we are excited to announce that this year’s **Call for Participation is now open!** We invite Ethereum protocol researchers and developers to apply to speak or host a workshop about a topic that aligns with the conference tracks outlined on our website.

Protocol Berg v2 is a two-day technical conference organized by the [Department of Decentralization](https://dod.ngo/) and hosted in Berlin. The event is for engineers, researchers, philosophers, and anyone else really interested in protocol, network, and decentralized infrastructure. Our goal is to offer different ecosystems a space to come together to exchange concepts and technology, talk about shared open problems, and share learnings.

Apply to speak here:
