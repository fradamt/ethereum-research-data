# Mitigating Sandwich Attacks at the Protocol Level

In this write-up, I will explain what MEV is, show a few examples. Then I will propose a few ideas on how we could go about mitigating one form of MEV — namely sandwich attacks. In process, we’ll talk about relayers like Flashbots, and how sandwich attack can already be avoided today.

**If you are already knowledgeable on MEV** : First, and while I’m by no means an expert, rest assured that this is not a super naive take on MEV. As the refrain go, we want to “minimize what MEV we can, democratize the extraction of what MEV is left”. The ideas presented here definitely fall into the “minimize what we can”. I’m also not entirely sure we should pursue them, and these are not new ideas, but I think they’re presented in a way that is conducive to conversation. **Feel free to skip** to the section titled “Preventing Sandwich Attacks at the Protocol Level”.
