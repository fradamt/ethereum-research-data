# RFC: Endogenous Parameterization for Post-Asset Economies (The Ontological Protocol v3.3)

I am proposing a mechanism to solve the **AI Attribution Problem** without relying on external oracles or DAOs.

### The Problem

In a regime of zero-marginal-cost reproduction (Generative AI), traditional “Store of Value” models fail because scarcity becomes artificial (rent-seeking). We need a metric for the **Flow of Value** (Causal Enablement).

Current solutions (watermarking, copyright) try to enforce artificial scarcity. I propose a thermodynamic approach that tracks **causal chains** instead of assets.

### The Proposal: The Ontological Protocol (v3.3)

A DAG-based protocol that derives its thermodynamic constants endogenously:

1. Price (Bprod​): Discovered via the 5th percentile of valid transaction burns. This creates a thermodynamic floor based on “Proof of Sacrifice” (OpEx), anchoring the system to physical reality (Landauer Limit proxy).
2. Attribution (α): Determined via Algorithmic Information Theory (LZMA-Compression ratios).

 High Structure (Code, Axioms) → High Attribution (α≈1).
3. High Entropy (Noise) → Zero Attribution (α≈0).
4. Persistence (λ): We introduce the Law of Structural Persistence (λ≡α). This implies that truth does not decay. Foundational work (Infrastructure, Education) maintains its causal weight indefinitely (Lindy Effect), while speculative noise decays instantly.

### Simulation & Logic

We implemented a “Genesis Diagnosis” (Shadow Run) on fiat-economic data. The model correctly re-evaluates “Silent Giants” (Open Source Maintainers, Care Work) vs. “Rent Seekers” purely based on topological analysis, without moral axioms.

### Request for Feedback

I am looking for critique specifically on the **Cybernetic Lung** (Section 3.2). We utilize a PID-Controller to adjust minting difficulty, targeting a **Branching Ratio (σ) of ≈1.0** (Edge of Chaos). Is a target of σ≈1 sufficient to prevent spam propagation while allowing for deep causal chains, or do we need a stricter dampening factor for nodes with low centrality?
