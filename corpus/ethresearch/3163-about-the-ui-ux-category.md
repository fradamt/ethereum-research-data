# About the UI/UX category

(Replace this first paragraph with a brief description of your new category. This guidance will appear in the category selection area, so try to keep it below 200 characters. **Until you edit this description or create topics, this category won’t appear on the categories page.**)

Use the following paragraphs for a longer description, or to establish category guidelines or rules:

- Why should people use this category? What is it for?
- How exactly is this different than the other categories we already have?
- What should topics in this category generally contain?
- Do we need this category? Can we merge with another category, or subcategory?
