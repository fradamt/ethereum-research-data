# Introducing the Flint Programming Language for ewasm

**Flint-2**

Last year the safer blockchain programming language Flint was developed. With the support of our friends in the Ethereum Foundation, the development of Flint has continued. There is a new compiler (hence [Flint-2](https://github.com/flintlang/flint-2/blob/cf23885accb4d5b41c791d651d5079e76b3f7793/docs/guide.md)) written in Rust. Flint-2 has support for communication between contracts, possibly written in different languages.

Flint targeted Solidity (via Yul) whereas Flint-2 has been designed to be used with multiple backend targets. Flint-2 currently has Libra and an Ethereum (ewasm) backends. As the targeted backends are currently under active development, to provide a usable compiler, Flint-2 needs to track the development.

We are looking for like-minded people to join our development effort. There are many different directions this work could go, and some might be suitable for a masters capstone or individual project.

Please get in touch, if our description of Flint-2 looks promising to you, and you like working on compilers. Just email [susan@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:susan@imperial.ac.uk) and we can discuss potential collaborations.
