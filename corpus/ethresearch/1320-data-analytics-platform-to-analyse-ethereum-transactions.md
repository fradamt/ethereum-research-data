# Data analytics platform to analyse ethereum transactions

Hello all,

I am creating a browser based data-analytics platform to analyse ethereum transactions Analyse Ether (https://www.analyseether.com/). Any user can query, visualize and share their analyses and earn a portion of the ad-revenue.

We have published the MVP of the idea and are looking for first batch of users (registration form available on website), to test, break and provide feedback about the platform. Can be used as a tool to perform research.

Any suggestions are more than welcome ![:smile:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/smile.png?v=9)
