# On-chain Distributed RNG using ZK?

I am looking to create a simple **smart contract  based algorithm**  that provides **common random number generation**, provided that t out of N participants are honest, where t * 2 > N

The algorithm has the following properties

- at the end, all honest participants know the common random number R
- malicious participants are not able to influence R or make the algorithm stuck.

*Preliminary setup*

Each participant j register her public keys P[j] with a smartcontract DRNGManager.

Together with the public key P[j] each participant  submits to DRNGManager a ZK proof that P[j] is valid and that she knows the corresponding private key.

*Commit phase*  **(10 minutes)**

Each participant j generates a random  EC polynomial of degree t  POLY[j]().

The participant then generates a vector of polynomial evaluations A[i] = [POLY[j](i)] at N integer points  i.

The participant will then encrypt the evaluations to obtain  a vector of encrypted polynomial evaluations G_[j] = [Encrypt(POLY[j](i))].

It then submits to `DRNGManager`

- vector G[j][i]
- commitment to POLY[j]
- a ZK-proof that G[j][i] were correctly generated from POLY[j].

DRNGManager verifies ZK-proof on receipt

After the commit phase, DRNGManager will contain  j valid vectors G[j], where j >= t.

*Reveal phase*. **(10 minutes)**

Each participant j will be able to  decrypt and reveal to DRNGManager a vector of points POLY[j](i). The participants will then submit these vector to DRNGManager together with a ZK proof that reveal was done correctly.

After the reveal phase, DRNGManager  will include k reveals, where k >= t.

*RNG computation phase*. For each committed polynomial POLY[j], each participant is then able calculate random number R[j] = POLY[j](0). The common random is then XOR of all R[j]
