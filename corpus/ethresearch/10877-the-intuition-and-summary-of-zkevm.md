# The intuition and summary of zkEVM

Have a write-up about the zkEVM project (link below). In this article, we identified the design challenges faced by zkEVM in the past and explained why this solution seems finally possible today. We also used our intuition to propose a high-level framework on how to build this solution from scratch.

Hope to incentivize more technical discussions about different approaches for general-purpose zk-Rollup (i.e. Starkware’s wrap, zkSync’s compiler-based approach and so on).
