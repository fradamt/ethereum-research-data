# What are Non-transferable ID tokens?

I came across this term in the Ethererum Foundation Wave3 grants [blog post.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/08/17/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-3/) Is it just referring to non-transferrable tokens as mentioned in [EIP-1238](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1238) or is it something different may be using concepts from [Identity](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/725) and [Claim Holder](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735) EIPs?
