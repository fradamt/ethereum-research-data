# Mass Exit and challenges

Suppose a Plasma chain with a high number of users; they trigger a mass exit due to the operator creating a bad block. Who will challenge all the exits?

It’s expected to all users to challenge each others’  exits so no one can exit with fraudulent UTXOs even in case of a mass emergency exit?

Thanks.
