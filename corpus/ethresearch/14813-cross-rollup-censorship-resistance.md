# Cross rollup censorship resistance

Hello, has anyone thought about/solved cross rollup censorship resistance, i.e. cross rollup forced transactions? These would be like L1->L2 forced txs, except L2->L2, without going through L1, (i.e. they should also be cheap).

It seems these would be great, as it would make trust in the ecosystem larger, make it easier to start a rollup, and be a better ux for users.

I have some thoughts, but they would require a major overhaul of the system, so I guess it’s worth checking with the big brains if there are current simple solutions ![:slight_smile:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/slight_smile.png?v=12)  Thank you.
