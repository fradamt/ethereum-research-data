# Introductions for the Eth1.x research group

Please respond to this thread with a brief introduction.  Suggested things to include:

1. Who are you
2. What do you working on
3. Specific areas of research you are interested in.

## Replies

**holiman** (2019-11-08):

1. Martin Holst Swende
2. Security (across the entire eth infrasructure), Go-ethereum dev
3. 1.x Research areas interested in:
3.1 Managing state, mid-to-long term, pruning, statelessness
3.2 Mid-term evolution of protocols, eth and discovery and sync protocols
3.3 EVM optimization strategies

**lithp** (2019-11-08):

1. Brian (lithp in most places), part of the Snake Charmers team
2. The Trinity client
3. At the moment I’m most excited about reducing the requirements to run a node, so that more people run nodes. The two things I’ve thought most about are better sync protocols so new nodes can become useful faster and ways to reduce disk requirements, such as stateless clients, so people will be more willing to run nodes.

**pipermerriam** (2019-11-08):

1. Piper (pipermerriam in most places), Snake Charmers team lead
2. Mostly the Trinity client, Lots of Python stuff.
3. Beam sync, Stateless clients, Making client development easier and making running a client easier.

**AlexeyAkhunov** (2019-11-08):

1. Alexey, Ethereum researcher and developer
2. Turbo-Geth + Stateless Ethereum prototyping/specifications
3. Most of the things on this list: Ethereum 1 Research topics - HackMD, particularly those where there is more text  warning - this is not a permalink, it will keep changing

**carver** (2019-11-08):

1. Jason Carver (@carver typically)
2. Trinity, other python things
3. Reducing friction to launching nodes, so:

Sync Speed
4. Sync Speed
5. Sync Speed
6. Growing disk usage
7. Sync Speed

**shemnon** (2019-11-09):

1. Danno Ferrin (@shemnon most places)
2. Hyperledger Besu, and just plain old Besu too.
3. My interests, in order of importance
a. Stateless clients and other means to address state size
b. EVM evolution
c. EVM performance

**gichiba** (2019-11-12):

1. Griffin Hotchkiss (@gichiba most places)
2. Writing (technical), documenting the state of 1.x research for a wider audience, asking basic questions.
3. I’ll follow the pulse of what lines of research seem the most fundamental, which at the moment I believe is stateless clients.

**adlerjohn** (2019-11-12):

1. John Adler
2. Solving the scalability problem
3. On the Eth 1.x front, optimistic rollup and improvements to the base chain for rollup schemes, which make state growth a non-issue in practice

Multi-threaded data availability and data pre-processing (research) (first EIP of several)
4. Integrating data availability proofs to get sharding scalability without sharding (research)

**MrChico** (2019-11-12):

1. Martin Lundfall
2. Formal semantics (beacon chain), hevm, spec writing
3.

- Statelessness
- Concurrent tx processing
- EVM evolution

**matt** (2019-11-12):

1. Matt Garnett
2. Eth2 virtual machine, stateless execution, and EE design
3. Understanding the needs of Eth 1.x to help advocate for eth2 VM design decisions

---

**quickBlocks** (2019-11-12):

- Thomas Jay Rush
- TrueBlocks
- I’m just going to be a watcher. I suspect that stateless clients will make recovery of transaction histories from previously unmonitored addresses in a decentralized way much more difficult if not impossible. Need to educate myself, though.
