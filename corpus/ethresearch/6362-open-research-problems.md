# Open research problems

Hi there,

Is there any **updated** comprehensive list of open problems you guys currently working on or planning to work on?

It of course depends on what kind of research problems you are interested in, but one resource that we just put online is [challenges.ethereum.org](http://challenges.ethereum.org), which lists all the different bounties we have to encourage research in topics critical to the future of Ethereum.
