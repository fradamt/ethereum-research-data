# A quick script for estimating how unpredictable the sequencer is with various SSLE setups

This assumes a setup as follows:

- There is a buffer of size BUFFER_SIZE
- Every slot, TAKE_SIZE proposers are taken from the front of the buffer, and TAKE_SIZE new proposers are added.
- Every slot, SHUFFLE_SIZE randomly selected indices in the buffer are reshuffled

The script models the buffer as probability distributions, and computes basic properties of these distributions. For simplicity it focuses on the average probability distribution of the *first* proposer in each slot, so a probability of 0.038 means that you can identity a validator that has a 3.8% chance of being the first proposer.

One result:

```python
5000 rounds completed
Tested shuffling 512 proposers in each slot and taking 65, with a buffer size of 2048
Average probability of most likely proposer: 0.038 (1 in 26.327)
Average entropy: 4.344 nats (equiv to uniform distribution of 77.046 proposers)
```

The script:

```python
import random, math

BUFFER_SIZE = 2048
SHUFFLE_SIZE = 512
TAKE_SIZE = 65
ROUNDS = 5000

# Object representing probability distributions
class ProbabilityDistribution():
    def __init__(self, probs):
        assert 0.9999999  N/2 more efficient to select the complement
    if selections > buffer_size // 2:
        inverse_selections = select_indices(buffer_size, buffer_size - selections)
        return set(i for i in range(buffer_size) if i not in inverse_selections)
    o = set()
    while len(o) < selections:
        o.add(random.randrange(buffer_size))
    return o

def simulate_proposer_selection():
    # Initialize the buffer with known proposers
    proposer_buffer = [ProbabilityDistribution({i:1}) for i in range(BUFFER_SIZE)]
    # These variables help us later compute the average max and entropy
    max_accumulator = 0
    entropy_accumulator = 0
    # For each round.....
    for r in range(ROUNDS):
        # Pick indices to shuffle
        shuffle_indices = sorted(select_indices(BUFFER_SIZE, SHUFFLE_SIZE))
        # Average over all possible shuffles
        avg = ProbabilityDistribution.average([proposer_buffer[index] for index in shuffle_indices])
        for index in shuffle_indices:
            proposer_buffer[index] = avg
        # Probability of most likely proposer
        max_prob = max(list(proposer_buffer[0].probs.values()))
        # Entropy of the probability distribution
        entropy = sum([-x * math.log(x) for x in proposer_buffer[0].probs.values()])
        max_accumulator += max_prob
        entropy_accumulator += entropy
        # Remove the desired number of proposers and replace them with new ones
        for _ in range(TAKE_SIZE):
            proposer_buffer.pop(0)
            proposer_buffer.append(ProbabilityDistribution({BUFFER_SIZE+r:1}))
        if r % 100 == 99:
            print("{} rounds completed".format(r+1))
    # Print parameters and results
    print("Tested shuffling {} proposers in each slot and taking {}, with a buffer size of {}".format(SHUFFLE_SIZE, TAKE_SIZE, BUFFER_SIZE))
    avg_max = max_accumulator / ROUNDS
    print("Average probability of most likely proposer: {:.3f} (1 in {:.3f})".format(avg_max, 1/avg_max))
    avg_entropy = entropy_accumulator / ROUNDS
    print("Average entropy: {:.3f} nats (equiv to uniform distribution of {:.3f} proposers)".format(avg_entropy, math.exp(avg_entropy)))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    simulate_proposer_selection()
```
