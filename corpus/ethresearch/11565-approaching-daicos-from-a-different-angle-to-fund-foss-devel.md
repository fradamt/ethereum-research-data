# Approaching DAICOs from a different angle to fund FOSS development

This idea is very similar to Vitalik Buterin’s original post a few years ago where he proposed a DAICO as a solution to sustainably fund open source teams. However, the approach I’m thinking about taking is to instead leverage a dilution method rather than creating a treasury to be taken from slowly which is what I understood his proposal to be.

I think by restructuring the problem in this way it allows for markets to form around maintainership in a way that addresses some of the core problems raised in that original [thread](https://ethresear.ch/t/explanation-of-daicos/465).

Here’s a quick high level conceptual [blog post](https://kyledenhartog.com/sustainable-OS-dev-daos/) I threw together to describe the concept.

I’m curious what others think about this restructuring of the problem and if there’s a fatal flaw that I’ve missed in my thinking.
