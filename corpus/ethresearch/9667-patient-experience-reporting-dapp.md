# Patient experience reporting Dapp

Patient experience reporting Dapp

**Intro Problem**

Decentralization has massive potential in the healthcare sector. Currently, the healthcare regulation organizations broadly dictate patient care guidelines. If there was a way to report and publish patient experience data in a decentralized fashion - it would eliminate the “big-money” influences that currently undermine the optimal delivery of patient-centered care. The current methods of patient experience data collection are post-hoc surveys

**Concept**

Ideally, the prototype application would be *distributed to the patients upon discharge. The survey would ask 3-5 objective questions related to the patient experience. Possibly reward *participation. The data would be aggregated and *displayed in a simple “yelp” style ranking system.

**Background**

Patient satisfaction is the illusive red herring of hospital system operation metrics. In my opinion, patient satisfaction will never be an appropriately tracked metric without the implementation of inherent *trust into the effort. Decentralization would provide this trust on the consumer end. Moreover, the trust could be translated into real-world efforts to reproduce positive patient experiences. This would revolutionize an industry that is increasingly data/outcome driven.

Much like the restaurant industry, healthcare operates in two modes of performance. The first mode is that of the professional/licensed industry standards. While the second mode is that of experience generation. While the serving staff gets “tipped” based on the service they provided, the tip is also contingent on mode 1 performance of quality and execution. Healthcare workers currently have no *incentive to optimize each and every patient experience within the bounds of the broader system.

As an alternative to *universality  of care. Decentralization would help redefine the narrative that is currently politically divided. There are valid arguments that access to quality healthcare should be available to all. But this argument presupposes the inherent quality of that care. With the development of a ranking database of care delivery systems, wider disparities could be not only identified, but addressed based on agile feedback.

Please, let me know what you think.

I’d like to expand this note, it’s pointing to the importance of data and who should own it.

Patient data should influence better health and using a dao would ensure the CDC and WHO data is available to anyone.

Let’s get something started here.
