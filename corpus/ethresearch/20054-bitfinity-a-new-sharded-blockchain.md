# Bitfinity: A new sharded blockchain

Using threshold BLS signatures we design a new blockchain that implements sharding, separating tokens from EVM processors. Bitfinity is linearly scalable and fast.

Bitfinity implements seamless cross-shard communication.

Using sharding techniques we also implement seamless cross-chain settlement and can bridge over Bitcoin to the EVM.
