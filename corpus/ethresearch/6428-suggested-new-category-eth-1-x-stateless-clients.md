# Suggested new category: Eth 1.x Stateless Clients

I’m starting to organize an Eth 1.x research group around the topic of stateless clients in the context of the 1.0 mainnet.  Can we get a category made for this?

There is now Eth1.x Research category (https://ethresear.ch/c/eth1x-research) plus

`stateless-client` tag (https://ethresear.ch/tags/stateless-client). Is that good enough for organizing the topics?

Yes, that is perfect.  Thank you.
