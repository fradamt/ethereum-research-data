# Somebody wants to help me implement polynomial decomposition algorithm?

I’m looking for someone with good knowledge of algebra to implement the algorithm described here:

https://www-polsys.lip6.fr/~jcf/Papers/jsc_FP09.pdf

The goal is to represent a circuit as a composition of quadratic circuits. Language: Python. Please answer if you are interested.
