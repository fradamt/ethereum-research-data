# New ACM article -- "Fair Decisions through Plurality: Results from a Crowdfunding Platform"

Hi all, I recently published a paper in the 5th annual ACM EAAMO conference on a pluralistic variant of QF and its application at Gitcoin:

https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3757887.3763019

The paper is co-authored with Glen Weyl and Chris Kanich. It goes through the reasoning behind our design of this new algorithm + some of the challenges and successes of implementing it in practice. We call the algorithm “CO-QF” in the paper (because I think it’s a nice name), but you may also know it as COCM or Cluster Matching.

The paper argues that CO-QF / COCM has some good things going for it, but I don’t it’s perfect either. So I’d like to hear your critiques and questions – hopefully these can inform future work.

Also, CO-QF represents a pretty flexible decision-making process that has applications beyond public goods funding with anonymous donations. So if you’re a DAO / other org curious about trying it out for internal decision making, please reach out to me at joeldmiller73 ~at gmail ~dot com. Thanks.
