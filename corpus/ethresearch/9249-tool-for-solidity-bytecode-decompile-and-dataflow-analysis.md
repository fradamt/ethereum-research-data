# Tool for Solidity bytecode decompile and dataflow analysis

I want to find the argument dependence in the solidity program through bytecode of solidity. Does anyone in community know any tools that can help me?

Thanks a lot

The best debugging tool I am aware of is Tenderly. We use it all the time and it saved us lots of money.
