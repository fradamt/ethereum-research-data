# Economic Security of a Combination of Restaking Protocols (EigenLayer in combination with Symbiotic, Jito and others)

Our paper “Economic Security of Multiple Shared Protocols” is about describing the economic security guarantees of architectures that combine restaking protocols for any AVS. This includes a mathematical description of the best architecture for this along with a robust mechanism for its security. This is the building block for what [Catalysis Labs](https://catalysis.network/) are building.

ABSTRACT : As restaking protocols gain adoption across blockchain ecosystems, there is a need for Actively Validated Services (AVSs) to span multiple Shared Security Providers (SSPs). This leads to stake fragmentation which introduces new complications where an adversary may compromise an AVS by targeting its weakest SSP. In this paper, we formalize the Multiple SSP Problem and analyze two architectures : an isolated fragmented model called Model M and a shared unified model called Model S, through a convex optimization and game-theoretic lens. We derive utility bounds, attack cost conditions, and market equilibrium that describes protocol security for both models. Our results show that while Model M offers deployment flexibility, it inherits lowest-cost attack vulnerabilities, whereas Model S achieves tighter security guarantees through single validator sets and aggregated slashing logic. We conclude with future directions of work including an incentive-compatible stake rebalancing allocation in restaking ecosystems.

This paper has been accepted to MARBLE 2025 and will appear in its proceedings.
