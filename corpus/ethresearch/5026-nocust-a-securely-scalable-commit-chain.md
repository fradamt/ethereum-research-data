# NOCUST - A Securely Scalable Commit-Chain

We are very excited to release an updated version of the NOCUST academic paper. NOCUST is a Commit-Chain or non-custodial side-chain to scale Blockchains through layer 2.

We added passive delivery (recipients can now be offline), added an experimental evaluation with gas costs etc, explained in-depth the collateral requirements (for instant finality) and having a new way to perform provably consistent checkpoints with zkSNARKS (also experimentally evaluated).

The paper can be found here:

[@guifel](/u/guifel) Thanks for sharing the paper. Just a quick question, is Nocust-ZKP fundamentally having difference from ZK-Rollups?
