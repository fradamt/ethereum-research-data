# What is the impact of sharding on minimum stake requirement?

Apology if this has been discussed before, but it is not clear from Casper V2 Spec if sharding is a hard requirement for 32ETH minimum stake. If anything, removing cross-linking would reduce the overhead, thus enable lower stake and more validator?

Thx
