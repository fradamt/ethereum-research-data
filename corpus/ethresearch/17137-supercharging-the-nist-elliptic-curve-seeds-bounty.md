# Supercharging the NIST Elliptic Curve Seeds Bounty

Hey guys, we just launched an [initiative](https://hackmd.io/@merkleplant/seeds-bounty) to supercharge the NIST Elliptic Curve seeds bounty. The aim is essentially to find the pre-image for the `P256` seed `c49d360886e704936a6678e1139d26b7819f7e90` (note that [EIP-7212](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7212) introduces a `P256` (a.k.a. `secp256r1` elliptic curve) precompile) given the major hint in the original bug bounty [announcement](https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/seeds-bounty):

Let’s show the world that Ethereum is a collective power of folks who truly care about what essentially powers the foundation of Ethereum: cryptography.

A major shoutout to [@merkleplant](/u/merkleplant) who has been the driver behind this initiative! Would appreciate spreading this initiative & any donations are ofc welcome ![:smiley:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/smiley.png?v=14)
