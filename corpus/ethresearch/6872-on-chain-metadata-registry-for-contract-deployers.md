# On-chain metadata registry for contract deployers

Hi all,

Just wrapped up releasing a new version of an on-chain metadata registry that allows deployment keys to link IPFS hashes to contract addresses. Users can also self-attest to a piece of data.

In this latest release, categories have been added so that there is a many-to-one relationship between IPFS multihashes and ethereum addresses. This is so dapps can also begin to share data with one another and possibly use the platform as a light reputation layer.

Calling all Solidity wizards to break the implementation and the governance rules laid out in the documentation ![:slight_smile:](https://ethresear.ch/images/emoji/facebook_messenger/slight_smile.png?v=14)

Any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome! Caching layer coming soon…
