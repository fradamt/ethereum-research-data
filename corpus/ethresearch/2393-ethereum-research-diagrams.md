# Ethereum Research Diagrams

I was fortunate to briefly meet [@vbuterin](/u/vbuterin) today during his busy schedule at the sharding workshop in Berlin, and I was excited when he revealed to me that there’s a Github repo with a collection of Ethereum research diagrams. Does anyone know the link?

There’s http://github.com/vbuterin/diagrams that has many of my diagrams, though it’s not very well organized or complete.
