# So. Is this really part of eth?

Hello. Sorry to bother you. Is okinami token ([twitter.com/okinamitoken](http://twitter.com/okinamitoken)) really part of eth surge as they claim or just another scam rug, as far as you know? They’re making all sorts of theories about being a zk rollup. Anonymous dev messaged “The Surge.” on Etherscan after Vitalik’s roadmap tweet, because there was a wave next to “The Surge”. They have a blockchain connection to Genesis and Russell Verbeeten. I’m even willing to pay to know whether this is real or not. Thank you.

**abcoathup** (2023-01-02):

Anyone can claim that they are building a rollup, they may also deliver or not deliver on their claims.

Their website doesn’t appear to make any claims and is just a link to their token with an unspecified purpose.
