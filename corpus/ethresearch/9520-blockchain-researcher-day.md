# Blockchain Researcher Day

Hey guys,

We are Organizing the Arab Blockchain week (12th-17th of June 2021) [virtual] https://www.arabblockchainweek.com/ . During this week we are organizing Blockchain researcher day [[Blockchain Researcher Day! – Arab Blockchain Week 2021](https://www.arabblockchainweek.com/blockchain-researcher-day/) ]  in the 13th of June 2021 as an initiative to support the Arab blockchain researchers in the blockchain domains and connect them with the global community where they could learn more and contribute to narrow down the gap in the local universities and empower the Arab world in blockchain domains.

We need your help to support our initiative through ( speaking , participating, endorsing, and of course your valuable feedback)

Thank you!
