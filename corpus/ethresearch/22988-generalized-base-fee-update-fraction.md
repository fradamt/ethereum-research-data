# Generalized base fee update fraction

Ethereum uses a constant `BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION` when updating the blob base fee each block, with the proportional change in the fee computed as:

```python
math.exp((blob_gas_used - TARGET_BLOBS * GAS_PER_BLOB) / BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION)
```

A new value for this constant has been included in each EIP that changes the target blob gas. It turns out that there is a simple generalization for computing the constant, consistent with both the value set in [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) and [EIP-7691](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7691), that would be appropriate for the blob parameter only (BPO) hardforks of [EIP-7892](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7892). This generalized update fraction calculation, also specified [here](https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/1402683134406955008/1403433219185053716), is:

```python
BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION = round(MAX_BLOBS * GAS_PER_BLOB / (2 * math.log(1.125)))
```

Mathematically, we can express the ideal (unrounded) value as

b = \frac{m}{2\ln(1.125)},

where m is the max blob gas per block. To see why this generalizes both EIP-4844 and EIP-7691, we will now set up the equations used by these EIPs and derive the generalized formula from them.

## Exposition

Define t as the target blob gas per block. Under EIP-4844, the target is at half of the max: t=m/2, and the blob base fee is [designed](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844#base-fee-per-blob-gas-update-rule) to increase or decrease by a maximum of 1.125 and 1/1.125 per block when blob usage is at its maximum or minimum, respectively. At max blob gas consumed, the equation for the proportional change in the fee becomes

e^{\frac{m-t}{b}} = e^{t/b} = 1.125.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides and rearranging for b, then substituting t=m/2, yields the specified equation:

b = \frac{t}{\ln(1.125)} = \frac{m}{2\ln(1.125)}.

Under EIP-7691, the `BLOB_BASE_FEE_UPDATE_FRACTION` is derived as “the mid-point between keeping the responsiveness to full blobs and no blobs constant”. The b that keeps the response to “full blobs” constant is

b_\text{full} = \frac{m - t}{\ln(1.125)}.

The b that keeps the response to “no blobs” constant is

b_\text{empty} = \frac{-t}{\ln\left(\frac{1}{1.125}\right)},

which via the logarithm rule: \ln(1/x) = -\ln(x), becomes

b_\text{empty}  = \frac{t}{\ln(1.125)}.

The “mid-point” (b_\text{full}+b_\text{empty})/2 simplifies to the generalized equation:

b = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{m - t}{\ln(1.125)} + \frac{t}{\ln(1.125)} \right) = \left( \frac{m - t + t}{2\ln(1.125)} \right) = \frac{m}{2\ln(1.125)}.

## Application

The generalized equation gives satisfactory percentage changes at any ratio. Table 1 outlines a few examples.

| Max:Target | Full % | Empty % | Full factor 1.125^k | Empty factor 1.125^k |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5{:}4 | +4.82\% | -17.18\% | k = \tfrac{2}{5} | k = -\tfrac{8}{5} |
| 4{:}3 | +6.07\% | -16.19\% | k = \tfrac{1}{2} | k = -\tfrac{3}{2} |
| 3{:}2 | +8.17\% | -14.53\% | k = \tfrac{2}{3} | k = -\tfrac{4}{3} |
| 2{:}1 | +12.50\% | -11.11\% | k = 1 | k = -1 |
| 3{:}1 | +17.00\% | -7.55\% | k = \tfrac{4}{3} | k = -\tfrac{2}{3} |
| 4{:}1 | +19.32\% | -5.72\% | k = \tfrac{3}{2} | k = -\tfrac{1}{2} |
| 5{:}1 | +20.74\% | -4.60\% | k = \tfrac{8}{5} | k = -\tfrac{2}{5} |

**Table 1.** Impact for full and empty blocks across various max:target ratios with the generalized update fraction.

Note in columns 4 and 5 that the base fee changes by a factor of 1.125^k, where k is a function of the consumed blob gas g:

k(g)=\frac{2(g - t)}{m}.

There is a complementary-ratio symmetry around 2:1. The magnitude of k is preserved when the target is moved an equal distance above or below the halfway point (m/2). Specifically, k_\text{full}(m{:}t) = -k_\text{empty}(m{:}(m-t)) and k_\text{full}(m{:}(m-t)) = -k_\text{empty}(m{:}t), which for example applies to the complementary ratios 3{:}1 and 3{:}2 as well as 4{:}1 and 4{:}3.

## Extension to gas normalization

The generalized equation naturally extends to the gas normalization approach outlined in [EIP-7999](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7999). This approach decouples the update fraction from any specific resource limit by being more direct: it normalizes the gas delta (g-t) by dividing it by the max gas m (referred to in EIP-7999 as the limit) when updating the running `excess_gas`. This allows a single, universal update fraction — independent of m — to be used for all resources, regardless of their individual limits.

The two approaches differ only in when the division by m occurs. In the generalized equation, m is placed in the numerator of the update fraction b. Since b itself is used as the denominator in the fee update exponent, (g-t)/b, this effectively places m in the denominator of the overall calculation.

Ultimately, the final fee change factor:

1.125^{\frac{2(g-t)}{m}}

remains the same. However, the normalization makes the architecture more robust, ensuring the price remains stable if a resource’s limit is changed, as that limit is already part of the normalized `excess_gas` update.

## Concluding points

The purpose of this post was the following:

1. To expose why the proposed equation generalizes previous EIPs.
2. To present the effect of the proposed equation across various max:target ratios, illustrating reasonable percentage changes and the complementary-ratio symmetry.
3. To set the stage for further optimization in EIP-7999. The final piece of the puzzle is to take advantage of the generalization properties of the equation, but apply m at an earlier stage, already when updating the excess_gas.
4. During the last ACDE, several participants only recognized the general properties after the discussion had concluded (via chat). This post can serve as a venue for a more informed conversation on establishing the proposed equation as the default for the update fraction going forward.

## Replies

**Xiawpohr** (2025-09-04):

Can we restore the maximum rate of change for the base fee to 12.5% regardless of the max:target ratio? We can use the following formula to calculate the fee update fraction.

b = \frac{\max(|g - t|)}{\ln(1.125)} \forall  0 \le g \le m

This approach helps maintain the general public’s understanding of the gas update rule while eliminating the need to maintain a 3:2 max:target ratio across all BROs to preserve responsiveness to full blobs and no blobs.
