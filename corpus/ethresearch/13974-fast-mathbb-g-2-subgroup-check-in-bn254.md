# Fast $\mathbb{G_2}$ subgroup check in BN254

# Fast \mathbb{G_2} subgroup check in BN254

*Authors: Antonio Sanso and Chih Cheng Liang (Ethereum Foundation - https://ethereum.foundation/)*

[BLS12-381](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/bls12-381) is now universally recognized as **the pairing curve** to be used *given our present knowledge*. As propably know though [BN254](https://hackmd.io/@jpw/bn254) is currently the only curve with precompiled contracts on Ethereum for elliptic curve addition, scalar multiplication, and pairings ([EIP 196](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-196), [EIP 197](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-197)), this until the inclusion of [EIP-2537](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537).

## Did you say \mathbb{G_2}?

One problem with using BN254 in smart contract though is the expensive G2 operations. In particular the required validation of checking that a point lies in the correct subgroup is [prohibitively expensive](https://hackmd.io/@liangcc/BkluJoQgF?type=view#The-issue-of-intepreting-the-failing-precompile-call).

## Subgroup membership testing for \mathbb{G_2}

The naive way to check that a group lies in the correct subgroup is to multiply by the order. This might be particular expensive for G2 on BN254. The order of the curve is a 254 bits number. According to the benchmark data provided wih the [BN256G2 contract](https://github.com/musalbas/solidity-BN256G2/blob/45a07eecabf7402d12897a975135caba7a4254f2/BN256G2.sol). Concrete number shows that the gas cost is about **4,000,000 for a 256-bit scalar multiplication**. So the cost of the naive subgroup check is dominated by the scalar multiplication:

```auto
    function isOnSubgroupG2Naive(uint256[4] memory point)
        internal
        view
        returns (bool)
    {
        uint256 t0;
        uint256 t1;
        uint256 t2;
        uint256 t3;
        // solium-disable-next-line security/no-inline-assembly
        assembly {
            t0 := mload(add(point, 0))
            t1 := mload(add(point, 32))
            // y0, y1
            t2 := mload(add(point, 64))
            t3 := mload(add(point, 96))
        }
        uint256 xx;
        uint256 xy;
        uint256 yx;
        uint256 yy;

        (xx,xy,yx,yy) = BN256G2.ECTwistMul(r,t0,t1,t2,t3);
        return xx==0 && xy==0 && yx==0  && yy==0;
    }
```

**Can we do any better?**

Probably yes. BN254 has *j*-invariant equal to zero so is equipped with an extra endomorphism (in addition to scalar multiplication and Frobenius). So at the very least we could rely on [GLV](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-44647-8_11).

### Better than GLV

The last section of [BN254 For The Rest Of Us](https://hackmd.io/@jpw/bn254) already suggests a nice improvements that leverages the untwist-Frobenius-twist endomorphism introduced by [Galbraith-Scott](https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/117.pdf):

\psi = \Psi^{-1}\circ\phi_p\circ\Psi

where \Psi is the twist map and \phi_p is the Frobenius morphism.

Now thanks to a Theorem by [El Housni et al](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/352.pdf) in order to verify that a point is in the correct subgroup is enough to check that \psi(P) = [6x^2]P where x is the seed of the BN254 curve. Given the fact that computing the endomorphism on the left side is really fast this is really a good improvement. We passed from a 256-bit scalar multiplication (the order) to a **125-bit scalar multiplication** (the seed x is relatively small **63 bits**).

# …and even better

This is not the end of a story though. A [recent paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/348.pdf) improved even further the status quo (employing the same endomorphism).

**The work required is a single point multiplication by the BN seed parameter x (with some corner case that we are going to check below)!!**

Indeed assuming that the seed x satisfies that x \not\equiv 4~(\textrm{mod}~13) and x \not\equiv92~(\textrm{mod}~97) in order to verify that a point is in the correct subgroup is enough to check that [x+1]P + \psi([x]P) + \psi^2(xP)= \psi^3([2x]P). Basically a  **64-bit scalar multiplication**.

For BN254 we have

```auto
sage: x
4965661367192848881
sage: assert x % 13 != 4
sage: assert x % 97 != 92
```

At this point we went ahead and implemented these function in solidity going from a **4,000,000 gas cost to about a 1,000,000**

```auto
    function _FQ2Mul(
        uint256 xx, uint256 xy,
        uint256 yx, uint256 yy
    ) internal pure returns (uint256, uint256) {
        return (
            submod(mulmod(xx, yx, N), mulmod(xy, yy, N), N),
            addmod(mulmod(xx, yy, N), mulmod(xy, yx, N), N)
        );
    }

    function _FQ2Conjugate(
        uint256 x, uint256 y
    ) internal pure returns (uint256, uint256) {
        return (x, N-y);
    }

    function endomorphism(uint256 xx, uint256 xy,
        uint256 yx, uint256 yy) internal pure returns (uint256[4] memory end) {

        // Frobenius x coordinate
        (uint256 xxp,uint256 xyp) = _FQ2Conjugate(xx,xy);
        // Frobenius y coordinate
        (uint256 yxp,uint256 yyp) = _FQ2Conjugate(yx,yy);
        // x coordinate endomorphism
        (uint256 xxe,uint256 xye) = _FQ2Mul(epsExp0x0,epsExp0x1,xxp,xyp);
        // y coordinate endomorphism
        (uint256 yxe,uint256 yye) = _FQ2Mul(epsExp1x0, epsExp1x1,yxp,yyp);

        end[0] = xxe;
        end[1] = xye;
        end[2] = yxe;
        end[3] = yye;
    }

    function isOnSubgroupG2(uint256[4] memory point)
        internal
        view
        returns (bool)
    {
        uint256 t0;
        uint256 t1;
        uint256 t2;
        uint256 t3;
        // solium-disable-next-line security/no-inline-assembly
        assembly {
            t0 := mload(add(point, 0))
            t1 := mload(add(point, 32))
            // y0, y1
            t2 := mload(add(point, 64))
            t3 := mload(add(point, 96))
        }

        uint256 xx;
        uint256 xy;
        uint256 yx;
        uint256 yy;
        //s*P
        (xx,xy,yx,yy) = BN256G2.ECTwistMul(s,t0,t1,t2,t3);

        uint256 xx0;
        uint256 xy0;
        uint256 yx0;
        uint256 yy0;
        //(s+1)P
        (xx0,xy0,yx0,yy0) = BN256G2.ECTwistAdd(t0,t1,t2,t3,xx,xy,yx,yy);
        //phi(sP)
        uint256[4] memory end0 = endomorphism(xx,xy,yx,yy);
        //phi^2(sP)
         uint256[4] memory end1 = endomorphism(end0[0],end0[1],end0[2],end0[3]);
        //(s+1)P + phi(sP)
        (xx0,xy0,yx0,yy0) = BN256G2.ECTwistAdd(xx0,xy0,yx0,yy0,end0[0],end0[1],end0[2],end0[3]);
        //(s+1)P + phi(sP) + phi^2(sP)
        (xx0,xy0,yx0,yy0) = BN256G2.ECTwistAdd(xx0,xy0,yx0,yy0,end1[0],end1[1],end1[2],end1[3]);
        //2sP
        (xx,xy,yx,yy) = BN256G2.ECTwistAdd(xx,xy,yx,yy,xx,xy,yx,yy);
        //phi^2(2sP)
        end0 = endomorphism(xx,xy,yx,yy);
        end0 = endomorphism(end0[0],end0[1],end0[2],end0[3]);
        end0 = endomorphism(end0[0],end0[1],end0[2],end0[3]);

        return xx0 == end0[0] && xy0==end0[1] && yx0==end0[2]  && yy0==end0[3];
    }
```
