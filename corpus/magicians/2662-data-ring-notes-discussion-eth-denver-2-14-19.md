Since we’re a ‘permissionless’ organization, I’ll take the liberty to extract the issues we discussed in Denver into separate conversations on this forum. Links to individual discussions here:

[Problem Statement](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/data-ring-problem-statement/2681)

[Standard Query Interface](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/data-ring-topic-query-interface/2682)

[Provider Interface / Running a Node](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/data-ring-topic-provider-infrastructure-running-nodes/2683)

[Real World Data / Oracles](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/data-ring-topic-real-world-data-oracles/2684)

[Precompiles / Data Verification](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/data-ring-topic-precompiles-crypto-primitives-for-data-verification/2685)

Cat Herding (action items from the Denver data ring):

**Action item:**  @Corey will begin an EIP and foster conversation on Eth Magicians.

**Action item:**  [@Patrick](/u/patrick) will start a thread about what is required for devs to run nodes.

**Action Item:**  [@tjayrush](/u/tjayrush) will write a Medium post and start an EIP related to building indices.

**Action Item:**  [@Alex](/u/alex) will post links to materials which explain Oracles in the eth magicians discussion.

**Action Item:** [@wildmolasses](/u/wildmolasses) will break down existing dapps by data source / retrieval method

Paris Council:

Also, has anyone started planning an agenda for the Paris meeting? I’ll add a conversation for that as well, unless I hear otherwise.

I am also willing to volunteer. I can help with the following tasks:

1. will start a thread about what is required for devs to run nodes
2. will break down existing dapps by data source / retrieval method
