# How can I find talents in the crypto world

Hi guys I’m new here, I in this space for almost four years now. I still love it and passionate about it.

QUESTION: Any recommendation on where to find talent to build projects?

Developers and Defi masters. I know top talents cost money. We want to create something and need help.

Any ideas where to start???

Thank you all in advance
