# Suggested structure for each Working Group session

*Please use this format so that each working group can find its mission and follow through on that mission.*

**Initialize the work session**

- who champions this work?
- who can facilitate the discussion? (please review How)
- who can take notes? (please link to resources in a new thread on the Forum)

**Describe what this group is focusing on**

**Take action by answering 6 questions**

- who are the stakeholders? (be specific)
- what are the top concerns of the stakeholders?
- how do we coordinate action?
- how do we document?
- how do we prototype?
- what are the next actions?

**Update the thread’s first post** with the above information

- add links to artifacts (Google Docs, HackMD pages, Telegram rooms, etc)
- the notes-taker can present this at the end-of-day
