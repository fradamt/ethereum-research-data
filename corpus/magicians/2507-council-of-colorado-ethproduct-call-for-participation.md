# Council of Colorado - EthProduct call for participation

I’m proposing to convene and lead an EthProduct ring meeting for Magicians just before EthDenver.  If you are interested, please add your name here https://hackmd.io/mQrjzVjVR_eDQbRZp6GFDA#Product-Management-Ring

I propose for us to continue discussing topics from our community call (e.g. nuances of web3 PM) but with an in-person workshop. If there are other suggestions, LMK.  Cheers!
