# Quadratic Mempool Service

Quadratic resource management is so powerful, fair and trustless, in combination with reflective L1 mempool modeling perhaps with oracles, service fee challenges could be tamed. There should be native L1 mempool algorithmic governance graced with a quadratic view of the demand.

I’m not an Ethereum expert, but I cannot believe that the L1 mempool is a free-for-all for miners.
