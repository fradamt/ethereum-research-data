# Authorship & Author Consent Proofs - Pre-EIP discussion

gm, this is the pre-PR discussion for the NFT Authorship Standard. There is currently no standardized way to determine the author of an NFT, and common techniques (custom methods and using the minter’s address) have serious drawbacks. This standard provides a standardized JSON field for author information, in addition to Author Consent Proofs (ACPs), which prove that an address agreed to be named as the author.

You can find the draft [here](https://gist.github.com/samuelemarro/528081c742b7795062366b3624140fa2).
