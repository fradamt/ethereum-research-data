# My topic is temporarily hidden - what to do?

I don’t know how to contact the admin [@jpitts](/u/jpitts) directly, so I decided to just open a new topic here. My previous topic is for some unknown reason “temporarily hidden”: [Batched meta transactions (from multiple users) - Is this ready for an EIP draft?](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/batched-meta-transactions-from-multiple-users-is-this-ready-for-an-eip-draft/4613)

May I ask why?

I just wanted to post an update today saying that I completed gas usage tests and explain more about my findings…

Hi! Probably the Discourse software marked this “hidden” because this is your first post here. I’ll fix it shortly…
