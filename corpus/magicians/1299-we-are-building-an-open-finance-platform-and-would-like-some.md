# We are building an open-finance platform and would like some experienced user's feedback! (Also sign up for our virtual hackathon if you are a hacker!)

We’ve building a platform to support an ecosystem of 3rd party apps and independently own Chat Hubs. [Settle](https://settle.finance/) is a platform for open finance. We are sharing 50% of our subscription revenue with the apps and chat hubs of Settle based on how much user attention they garner. To kickstart our ecosystem, our first competition is a thinkathon.

​

If you have an idea that would be a great 3rd party app on a platform like this, please submit a half page idea for how a cool settle app would work, and if your idea is among the top 3, you win ETH.

**Prizes:**

1st — $300 of ETH

2nd — $150 of ETH.

3rd — $50 of ETH.

Hi [@Spaded](/u/spaded), welcome.

We don’t restrict the [#action-item](/c/8-action-item) category but typically reserve it for broad ecosystems items.

We don’t really have an events or Hackathons category at the moment. I added [#hackathon](https://ethereum-magicians.org/tags/hackathon) & [#thinkathon](https://ethereum-magicians.org/tags/thinkathon) tags to your post. Cool idea.

Good luck with your events!
