# H-star name for Consensus Layer upgrade after Glamsterdam

## Update:

**Heze** chosen as H-Star name at [ACDT #64](https://forkcast.org/calls/acdt/064#t=3018), replacing Heka (which had been selected at [ACDC #168](https://forkcast.org/calls/acdc/168/#t=4054), as Heka wasn’t in the IAU catalog of stars)

---

A **H-star name** is needed for the Consensus Layer upgrade after Glamsterdam ([EIP-7773: Hardfork Meta - Glamsterdam](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7773)).

Assumes a cross layer upgrade combined with the Execution Layer upgrade (Bogotá)

The consensus layer uses [star names](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-pm/issues/215) for upgrades whilst the execution layer uses [Devcon cities](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/more-frequent-smaller-hardforks-vs-less-frequent-larger-ones/2929/33).

See: [Post-Merge Network Upgrade Naming Schemes](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rfc-post-merge-network-upgrade-naming-schemes/11977)

Recent upgrade names:

- Shapella (Shanghai + Capella)
- Dencun (Cancun + Deneb)
- Pectra (Prague + Electra)
- Fusaka (Fulu + Osaka)
- Glamsterdam (Gloas + Amsterdam)

Assuming a cross layer upgrade, any H-star name will be combined with the execution layer name **Bogotá** in a portmanteau ([Portmanteau generator](https://portmanteaur.com)), so any name choice should also consider this.

*(Apologies if I am stepping on the process for selecting star upgrade names, [I’m not a core dev](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1235979765879844864))*

**Heka** stands out for me. Looks easy to remember

We should probably also evaluate how the portmanteau sounds. Something like **Heka + Bogotá → Hekotá** has a nice futuristic ring to it. Keeping the name short and pronounceable matters.

**abcoathup** (2025-05-22):

**Helvetios** + **Bogotá** could be **Heltá**

Plus Helvetios is part of the Pegasus constellation.

**codebyMoh** (2025-05-22):

Helta is good one, Easy to remember

**taxmeifyoucan** (2025-05-30):

I would be careful with the list of names from wikipedia because star names can be different in various registries and some names are not recognized as regularly used names by IAU.

We already made this mistake in Glaos which is hard to find under this name in most registries. Let’s choose a name that’s more widely recognized like stars we did before, ideally something that might be easier to find on the night sky.

Here is a list that mostly overlaps with the wikipedia source but I would take a deeper look into context of each star, whether they are cool enough to be candidates [Star Names That Start With H - Little Astronomy](https://littleastronomy.com/star-names-that-start-with-h/)

Edit: Accidentally deleted my comment ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12) With a quick check in Stellarium, I believe considered stars are recognized with these names, although there are some alternatives.

Also considering observability, my favorite would be Hamal, it should be visible even with a naked eye in the night sky. Helvetios is also good option but only visible with a telescope

**LukaszRozmej** (2025-09-18):

This one is easy `Hoerikwaggo` is obviously the best.

Unless you would allow `Hydra` and [Herculis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/102_Herculis)

---

**Nerolation** (2025-09-19):

Homam + Bogota = Hogota

**meetrick** (2025-10-06):

Even though the meaning of the star name Helvetios matters, what’s more important is how well it blends with Bogotá.

I think Helvota (Helvetios + Bogotá) sounds really good. It feels smooth, balanced, and easy to pronounce, keeping a touch of the original elegance of Helvetios while fitting naturally with Bogotá.

I would like to request to change the star selected for the fork after Glamsterdam. So far we have always selected name of stars that are officially listed in the Internstional Astronomers Union catalog, which is maintained by a list of scientific members from all accross the globe.

Heka is not in that list, and if we do not follow a minimum standard then we risk ending up with very weird names found in an obscure corner of the internet. Nothing against the name itself, just about the methodology.

Funny enough, all the other names proposed in the OP are in the IAU catalog, Heka is the only impostor in that list.

It is likely too late to do that, given All Core Devs selected that name and the Meta EIP has been created.

Would appreciate your help and [@taxmeifyoucan](/u/taxmeifyoucan) in coming up with the best list of I-stars for [I-star name for Consensus Layer upgrade after Heka](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/i-star-name-for-consensus-layer-upgrade-after-heka/26717)

Well, I don’t agree. ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12)

I don’t want to be annoying on this, but if we are still discussing which EIPs go into Glamsterdam or not (which is the real critical part of a fork), I don’t think it is “too late” to correct the name of a hard-fork that might come in 2027.

If you don’t mind I would like to redo the poll with the same list of options, except Heka, and ask core developers to do the vote again. ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12)

[@leobago](/u/leobago) you can add it to the [ACDC #171 agenda](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1825) to see if there is interest in choosing a different name to Heka.  All Core Devs select the name, the poll is for signaling purposes.

I commented on the ACDC #170 agenda, [All Core Devs - Consensus (ACDC) #170, November 27, 2025 · Issue #1812 · ethereum/pm · GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1812#issuecomment-3577812176) but the call focus was on Glamsterdam scoping.  Naming feels like a low priority at the moment.

**leobago** (2025-12-01):

I will comment on it on the R&D Discord after Fusaka comes live on Mainnet.

seems like Hadar is missing from the vote

**leobago** (2025-12-12):

Thank you to all who voted!!

We now have a poll with even more participation than the original one (I have been pinging everyone), so we can go ahead and declare **Heze** as the winner!

We then have **Heze - Bogotá**. Here is a list of possible Portmanteaus for the H-fork:

- Hezotá
- Hezegotá
- Bogheze
- Hetá
- Hezogotá
- Bogotaze
- Hegotá

To everyone who voted here, please also vote in the Portmanteau ASAP.

- Hezotá
- Hezegotá
- Boheze
- Hetá
- Hezogotá
- Bogotaze
- Hegotá
- Boze

**taxmeifyoucan** (2025-12-12):

From the currently proposed list, these should be visible on northern night sky with naked eye: Haedus, Hamal, Hassaleh, Hatysa, Helvetios, Heze, Homam, Hydor

**abcoathup** (2025-12-15):

We also have people looking at the southern night sky ![:kangaroo:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/kangaroo.png?v=12) ![:telescope:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/telescope.png?v=12)

**leobago** (2025-12-15):

A few more details about Heze:

## Pronunciation

**Heze** is pronounced:

**HEH-zuh**

- IPA: /ˈhɛzə/
- Stress on the first syllable, with a soft final “uh” sound.

You’ll also sometimes hear a slightly sharper ending (*HEH-zeh*), but **HEH-zuh** is the most commonly accepted pronunciation in astronomy.

## What star is Heze?

Heze is the traditional name of **Zeta Virginis (ζ Vir)**, a star in the constellation **Virgo**.

## Meaning of the name

The name **Heze** comes from **Arabic**:

- Original Arabic: الحِزَّة (al-ḥizza)
- Meaning: “the corner” or “the angle”

This refers to the star’s position in the **outline of the Virgo constellation**, marking a “corner” point in the traditional star figure as seen by medieval Arabic astronomers.

## Historical context

- The name entered European astronomy through medieval Arabic star catalogs, which were later Latinized.
- Heze was officially standardized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2017 as the proper name for Zeta Virginis.

Finally, it looks like the Portmanteau will be **Hegotá**.

Eth Magicians polls have traditionally been used for signaling purposes only.  Core devs get to choose.

Added to the ACDE agenda: [All Core Devs - Execution (ACDE) #226, Dec 18, 2025 · Issue #1837 · ethereum/pm · GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1837#issuecomment-3658484387)

I just want Core Devs to select a name this week.
