# EIP-2280: erc-20 extension for native meta transactions support

Hey Magicians,

I published a draft for an interface to add native meta transactions to ERC-20 tokens, and also support EIP-712 and ERC-165. I also provided a complete implementation and set of tools to use the protocol.

The implementation is here: [GitHub - ticket721/mTKN](https://github.com/ticket721/mTKN)

And here is the initial draft: [EIPs/eip-2280.md at feat/mtkn-proposal · mortimr/EIPs · GitHub](https://github.com/mortimr/EIPs/blob/feat/mtkn-proposal/EIPS/eip-2280.md)

I’d love to discuss it and make this interface one of the first “meta-extension” of a famous standard (an important step if we want to build Relay Networks (Meta Miners !)).

Thank you for reading ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)
