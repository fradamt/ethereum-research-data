# Cryptotux, a linux image for workshops and development

Hi everyone,

I’ve been involved in a lot of teaching over the past year (universities, engineering schools, a blockchain dev boot camp …)  and developed a Linux image to facilitate development and workshops.

The server version is a  virtualbox image, with all the current development tools ( node, go, geth, parity, …) on which a user can connect over ssh. The full script is here [GitHub - cryptotuxorg/cryptotux: Linux images for crypto & blockchain education and development](https://github.com/cryptotuxorg/cryptotux)

You can have a preview live https://cryptotux.org/live

The desktop version features a full lightweight desktop, with additionally sublime text and visual code and their respective ethereum plugin, brave, firefox with metamask … It is lightweight to accommodate most users.

I’m at the stage where it suits my needs for my students, but I consider how this could be a collaborative project and helpful and be worth more efforts. I’m strongly interested in suggestions, from technical, to strategic, branding and potential partnerships.
