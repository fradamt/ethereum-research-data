# Paris: proposing an account abstraction roundtable

As the Magicians are putting together an event for Blockchain Week in Paris, and Account Abstraction seems to be one of the bigger topics, I thought it might be beneficial to try and make a dedicated Account Abstraction roundtable by the event - 3074 and alternatives can be discussed in an actual IRL setting. I don’t know who’s going to be there, though. Are any of the major voices in the conversation going to be there? (I’ll tag [@SamWilsn](/u/samwilsn) [@adietrichs](/u/adietrichs), and [@yoavw](/u/yoavw)  , though I don’t mean that to the exclusion of anyone else in the conversation, just don’t want to clutter this with a ton of @s) Otherwise, is there a general interest from anyone else here for something like this?

This would be great! IMO, the more pressing matter is a sub-field of AA – EOA migration. It seems like this is what’s holding up EIP-3074 and is more near-term than protocol AA.

That sounds like a fun and important roundtable.  At the moment I haven’t made arrangements to be in Paris.  I’ll see if I can make it.
