Suggesting “Osmanbey”, metro station in Istanbul right next to where Devconnect took place ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12)

Following the convention of naming metro stations. Easy to read an recognizible.

`Saulkrasti` - train station in Latvia. Direct translation means “sunny shores”.

Give this country which no-one speaks about some love please.

Symbolism:

In 2024 there was a country wide scandal about “Rail Baltica” project of modernising railroad infrastructure. It appeared that unhidden corruption with clearly infeasible deliverables was put in to the budget, which ended up majority of country train stations being unreconstructed, instead of promised new in-line floors to enter trains, country-wide, citizens were forced to jump in to mud for a year, watching under-finished construction sites.

Sunny shores (Saulkrasti) network symbolises hope, that Ethereum solutions tested at this network will eventually contribute towards solving global inefficiencies and transparency in budget allocations & large scale projects delivery.

Saulkrasti sounds great since “test network symbolises hope for sunny shores of future efficient and transparent technologies.”

**shemnon** (2025-09-30):

I don’t think we should replace sepolia in 2026, but in 2027, and sepolia should not go into LTS until 2027. My view is that Hoodi is a forced early deployment of the '26 chain, not a short-term holesky replacement.

This sets the performance standard that unless something exceptional happens that new testnets launch 2 years after the old one launched, and that unless there was a problem with the newer chain then the older goes into LTS for the next year and the newly launched chain fills the LTS chain’s role (community validators vs developer validators).  So there is one year of 2 testnets + an LTS testnet, then one year of only two testnets, then the cycle repeats.

**Ankita.eth** (2025-10-01):

**Suggested Testnet Name:** **Lumina**

**Lore / Meaning:**

- Derived from Latin lumen, meaning light.
- Represents clarity, transparency, and guidance, reflecting Ethereum’s mission for open and secure development.
- Symbolizes a bright path forward for testing new protocol upgrades on the Sepolia replacement.

**Pronunciation:** **LOO-mee-nah**

**Mascot / Symbol:** ![:star2:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/star2.png?v=12) Star or light beam, representing innovation and guidance.

**Why this name works:**

- Original & Technical: Not tied to any existing subway, train, or prior testnet name, keeping it fresh.
- Memorable & Simple: Easy to pronounce, short, and evocative.
- Symbolic: Conveys transparency, innovation, and hope—qualities aligned with Ethereum development and community values.
- Fits Testnet Naming Tradition: Like past testnets (Sepolia, Görli, Hoodi), it is unique, meaningful, and easy to reference.

I believe **Lumina** would be a fitting, forward-looking name for the new Sepolia replacement testnet.

Proposed next testnet name: **Changi**

Following the tradition of naming Ethereum testnets after metro stations, Changi Airport in Singapore, which is also an MRT station, has been regarded as one of the best airports in the world for multiple years.

**Why Changi?**

- Changi is globally recognized and easy to pronounce across different languages, making it accessible for the international dev community.
- I believe it’s a symbolic fit for an Ethereum testnet, just as Changi Airport is known as a world-class connection hub, the testnet serves as a critical bridge between development and mainnet.
