# What should the process be for getting changes made to the EIP process?

[@MicahZoltu](/u/micahzoltu) posted this in the ethereum/governance gitter channel:

> @Arachnid I’m curious, what do you think the process should be for getting changes made to the EIP process? It has been thrown around (pretty frivilously) that PRs should be made against EIP-1, but we can’t merge those as drafts (which is the process for making changes to the protocol). Is the idea that EIP-1 PRs are long lived and sit open indefinitely? Following the EIP process doesn’t feel like it really makes sense, as we can’t say, “economic participants can fork” (technically they could fork the EIP repo, but if that is really the intention I feel like it should be spelled out somewhere).

I feel like we are missing that right now. ![:grinning:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/grinning.png?v=12)

This is a fantastic question. As I’ve said elsewhere, as a starting point I think it’s helpful to understand how things work today (read: present source of dysfunction). My understanding on this topic is limited so I’m curious to hear what others have to say, but I’ve seen two things happen:

1. These get opened as EIPs e.g. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/894
2. PRs against EIP-1 e.g. https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/956
