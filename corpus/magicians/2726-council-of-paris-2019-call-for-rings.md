### Please fill out this form:

## to help us schedule rooms

If you can facilitate or take notes for a session, [check this guide out.](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/running-a-magicians-session/2652)

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to develop an understanding of which rings are participating in the Council of Paris and who is participating on each ring.

Further discussion here:

More broadly, don’t worry too much about “rings” – if there is a topic, EIP, or experience around the Ethereum ecosystem you’d like to discuss, please add yourself here. We’ll be wrangling the agenda so everyone has room and time to meet. As well, **your job is to spread the word and get people to sign up**. You can even consider having an organizing call ahead of Paris, write up some wiki or HackMD pages, or in general prep for having productive meetings during the time we are alll together in person.

**Please suggest a new ring and begin to organize if you know of a set of related EIPs or significant issues in the Ethereum community.**

The reason why it was determined to follow with this format and list the most popular rings of Prague 2018, is to ensure there will be continued dialogue, progress and accountability over the action items suggested in the rings. New rings will be added from the form.

Suggestion: if you think you will be a facilitator for a ring, please put “facilitator” next to your name under participants. If someone else already has a facilitator title, please coordinate with them.

*Exact times and rooms will be assigned as part of agenda wrangling process.*

## 15. Whisper-v2: Universal Secure Messaging for ETH2

Ethereum becomes a heterogeneous network of shards and different L2-nodes. It implies changes on secure messaging. Now many projects are reimplementing secure messaging instead of using whisper. It is a sign of an adoption problem. Let us fix it.

- Which projects working on own secure messaging now?
- What projects require secure messaging.
- How the unified secure messaging-as-service should looks like in ETH2. What are the requirements? How we collect them?
- Background discussion:
- Whisper-v2 : Request for requirements for ETH2 unified messaging protocol

## 18. “5 Whys" retrospective: "Why we are too slow in adopting innovations we are creating”?

It’s taken 16 months from Byzantium to Constantinople (still not in production), despite the fact that Constantinople is relatively noncontroversial and doesn’t actually change very much. According to the best estimates 1, we won’t have a functional (from the perspective of most layer two developers) Eth2 until 2021 (phase 2) at the earliest.

We try to ask 5 Whys recursive starting with “Why we are too slow…”

### Topics of Discussion

- 5 Whys retrospective: Why we are too slow in adopting innovations we are creating?
- Economical and other incentives of innovation adoption?
- Background discussions:
- Experiments we should be running
- Thought experiment: Ethereum has failed in 5 years. Why did it fail? How we can prevent it?

- In general: What is our social contract about immutables and invariants?
- Background discussion:
- Immutables, invariants, and upgradability

## 20. Protocols to preserve the people working on Ethereum’s integrity

After the events unfolded during this past weekend that resulted on a massive outburst of accusations, conspiracy theories, demands, and verbal violence triggered by mob mentality, it is time, as a community, that we take a look at other tech communities and develop our own protocols (in case of abuse of power, harassment), talk about what is tolerable and what we should condemn and in which form, and work on our own procedures to behave as a unified, however decentralized community that has mature protocols and processes to deal with event that might jeopardize people’s integrity, and therefore, Ethereum’s development (eth is developed by humans!)

This session will not be livestreamed. [Participation form is here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf26FZBbe787e8fNaac8Y7m0e72gxbkFmkkGi7SkP1uYIhhwA/viewform?usp=sf_link)
