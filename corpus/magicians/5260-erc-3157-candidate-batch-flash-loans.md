# ERC-3157 (Candidate) Batch flash loans

Batch flash loans are being segregated from ERC3156 to allow lenders and borrowers to choose whether to support single-asset, multiple-asset, or both kinds of flash loans.

So far there is a [draft PR](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/3234).

The biggest question at this point is whether to repeat all the stuff in ERC3156 (security considerations, etc…) or to reference it.
