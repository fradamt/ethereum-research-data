# How to start contributing to any ethereum projects?

I need guidance on how to start contributing in ethereum. I am very fascinated by ethereum and the best way to know more about it, is to work for it.

What kinds of skills do you have [@amit_gaikwad](/u/amit_gaikwad), and what technical directions are you interested in going toward?

Also, is there a problem domain or subject area you have experience with, e.g. games, websites, distributed systems, etc?

Hi [@amit_gaikwad](/u/amit_gaikwad),

Find an area that you are passionate about (NFTs, DeFi, DAOs, core devs) and find a project and join the community.

Show up every day and find a way to contribute.  Let people know what skills you have and how much time you have.

It really depends on what you are good at, what you enjoy and where you can create more value.

[ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org) is a good place to start! And then you can dive into the [contributing](https://ethereum.org/en/contributing/) page. ![:relaxed:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/relaxed.png?v=10)
