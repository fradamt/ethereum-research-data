# The Privacy Trilemma

The trilemma says **you can only have two out of three**:

**Privacy** – this means the industry needs confidential data on-chain to match Web2 financial apps. Otherwise, we’ll be stuck forever with trading/gambling/HODLing use cases.

**Ease of use** – without ease of use and ease of development, no one will use or build privacy apps.

**Classic Consensus** – this refers to the classic PoS consensus.

If you use Classic Consensus, **you can achieve privacy but at the expense of being prohibitively hard to use**.

This is very much like Windows fixing security using anti-virus software vs Mac being secure at its foundation.

If you want privacy and ease of use, **you must embed privacy into consensus**.

Questions?))

I’d love if you can expand which privacy use cases we can’t achieve at the Application layer without consensus changes from your point of view.
