# G-star name for Consensus Layer upgrade after Fusaka

**Update**:  [All Core Devs - Consensus (ACDC) #148, January 9, 2025](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-148-january-9-2025/22206) decided on **Gloas** as name for consensus layer upgrade after Fulu

---

A **G-star name** is needed for the Consensus Layer upgrade after Fusaka ([EIP-7607: Hardfork Meta - Fusaka](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7607)).

Assumes a cross layer upgrade combined with Amsterdam. ([EIP-7773: Hardfork Meta - Glamsterdam](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7773))

The consensus layer uses [star names](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-pm/issues/215) for upgrades whilst the execution layer uses [Devcon cities](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/more-frequent-smaller-hardforks-vs-less-frequent-larger-ones/2929/33).

See: [Post-Merge Network Upgrade Naming Schemes](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rfc-post-merge-network-upgrade-naming-schemes/11977)

Recent upgrade names:

- Shapella (Shanghai + Capella)
- Dencun (Cancun + Deneb)
- Pectra (Prague + Electra)
- Fusaka (Fulu + Osaka)

[@timbeiko](/u/timbeiko) has already [suggested](https://tim.mirror.xyz/CuRtFjkujKBqVsdvCGvthiPIYaZyzNc5sWIaExw2UpE) **Glamsterdam (Gl + Amsterdam)**

Assuming a cross layer upgrade, any G-star name will be combined with the execution layer name **Amsterdam** in a portmanteau ([Portmanteau generator](https://portmanteaur.com)), so any name choice should also consider this.

*(Apologies if I am stepping on the process for selecting star upgrade names, [I’m not a core dev](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1235979765879844864))*

I like Amsgar. Sounds like a name coming from LoTR.

I am not sure how [@adietrichs](/u/adietrichs) feels about this, though, as he himself is presumably a LoTR character.

Playing with AI to collect possible future upgrade names ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12)

1. Bogomesia (Bogota + Gomesia): it could symbolize a connection between Earth (Bogotá) and the cosmos (Gomeisa), representing innovation, exploration, and bridging earthly creativity with celestial inspiration.
2. Bogienah (Bogota + Gienah): it can represent freedom, exploration, and creativity, tying Bogotá’s vibrant culture to the limitless possibilities of the stars.
3. Bogacrux (Bogota + Gacrux): it could stand for finding one’s path or direction from a base of cultural and technological strength, inspired by the stars.
4. Bogloas (Bogota + Gloas): could signify the radiant glow of Bogotá, representing its cultural brilliance and global influence.

Feel free to add more to the list!

[@poojaranjan](/u/poojaranjan) this could be a cross layer upgrade combined with Amsterdam which there is already an upgrade Meta EIP ([EIP-7773: Hardfork Meta - Amsterdam](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7773)).

Given Devcon is now every two years, we would also need to use Devconnect city names if we ship an upgrade every year.

Can you regenerate your ideas with Amsterdam?  I don’t like Glamsterdam which could be the front runner.
