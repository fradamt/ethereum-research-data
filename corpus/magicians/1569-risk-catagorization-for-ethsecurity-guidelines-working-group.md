# Risk Catagorization for EthSecurity Guidelines Working Group

Develop a top level risk categorization that can be used to assess smart contracts.  It could address the content of the code, where a public contract that moves or stores assets is high risk and a contract that just moves no assets is low risk.

This topic was raised in the Guidelines Working group of EthSecurity.  The output will be used in the resulting guidelines and further refined later.
