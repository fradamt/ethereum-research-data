# P2P exchanges parsers

Hi there! Recently I started in a crypto arbitrage on P2P deals. If you aren’t familiar, its based on the offers to buy crypto with fiat and sell crypto to fiat back with positive margin. So the main job - finding profitable chains between fiat, crypto, payment methods, limits and exchanges. Its a big deal to collect all information on hand and get it on time, and after some tries I been stuck in the excel, spreadsheets, notepad. In order to solve this problem I started to find services with that data, and I haven’t found something even a bit close to my expectations. Do you know any services?
