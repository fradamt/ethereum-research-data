# About the ERCs category

(Replace this first paragraph with a brief description of your new category. This guidance will appear in the category selection area, so try to keep it below 200 characters.)

Use the following paragraphs for a longer description, or to establish category guidelines or rules:

- Why should people use this category? What is it for?
- How exactly is this different than the other categories we already have?
- What should topics in this category generally contain?
- Do we need this category? Can we merge with another category, or subcategory?

Hi, I am trying to submit an ERC standard but I don’t see where I can create it. My profile is new so it might be that or I am missing something? Thanks
