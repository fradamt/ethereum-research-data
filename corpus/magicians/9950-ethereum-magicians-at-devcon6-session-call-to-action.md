# Ethereum Magicians at Devcon6 session [Call to action]

Hey Magicians!

The Ethereum Magicians Ops Ring Team is planning to host Community Hub at Devcon. **We would love to hear you ideas on what kind of discussions are you interested in!**

What EIPs we should talk about, issues in Ethereum or any other related topic we should discuss about. Who should we invite to join us in these sessions…

For inspiration, we hosted following sessions at Devcon 5 in Osaka:

- Eth 1.x
- Eth 1.x to 2.0
- Eth 2

And a few others full [recap from Osaka here](https://medium.com/ethereum-magicians/ethereum-magicians-sessions-recap-from-devcon5-aac6f36cb54a) - Medium article

Comment your session ideas bellow!

I think it would be refreshing to hear about plans post-merge. Here are some questions I have:

1. Are there any better consensus mechanisms we’re looking at for future Ethereum improvements (better than PoS)?
2. How will we go about making consensus more accessible?
3. Since we’ll be in Bogota, are there any plans to do more outreach and public goods in South American countries like Colombia?

There’s lots to discuss, but I think touching on these would be great.
