# ERC-404.. does it exists?

There have been numerous NFT collections launching as hybrid ERC721 / ERC20 (NFTs that can trade also as ERC20’s), they are launching under the pseudonym ERC-404, however, I cannot find that spec (which is kinda funny “404”).  Curious if there are any existing specs which cover these hybrid tokens?

I found them super interesting, it provides liquidity outside of traditional NFT marketplaces and I could see these collections taking off.

There isn’t an ERC404.

The creators haven’t gone through the ERC process but appeared to use the ERC prefix for marketing purposes.

EIP/RIP/ERC numbering changed to sequential from 7500 and is no longer the PR number.  Numbers are issued by EIP/RIP/ERC editors/associates.

There was a recent draft ERC with Hybrid functionality:  ERC7616: Hybrid Fungible Token
