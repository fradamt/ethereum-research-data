### Meeting Summary:

No summary overview available

**Click to expand detailed summary**

Micah and Killari discussed their pets’ behavior during feeding time, noting that rescue cats and dogs, regardless of their previous experiences with hunger, exhibit extreme excitement and aggression when food is available. They compared this behavior to humans’ reactions to meals, suggesting that while most humans enjoy food, they don’t exhibit the same level of excitement as animals. Micah wondered if humans raised in the wild would react similarly to meals, attributing the difference to social training.

Micah and Killari discussed Sina’s request to add all clients to the CI for compatibility testing, including those without Eth simulate implementation. Killari expressed concerns about maintaining compatibility with clients that frequently change their builds, questioning if the process was fully automated. They agreed to clarify the details with Sina in a separate conversation.

### Next Steps:

- Micah and Killari to discuss with Sina on Telegram about enabling all clients in the test suite for Eth simulate compatibility testing.
- Micah and Killari to clarify with Sina the implications of adding non-supporting clients to the Hive test suite and how it might affect overall test failures.
- Micah to investigate the current automation status of the Hive testing system for client updates.
- Killari to review the process of updating client versions in the Hive test suite and identify potential improvements to reduce manual intervention.
- Micah and Killari to explore options for handling pull requests and merging tests without causing conflicts with new client versions.
