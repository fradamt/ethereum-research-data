# ERC-7769: JSON-RPC for ERC-4337 Account Abstraction

This ERC describes the JSON-RPC calls used to communicate with ERC-4337 bundler.

It was previously included in ERC-4337 itself, but was extracted into a separate document.

This specification is currently identical to the one previously dedfined in ERC-4337 and does not require any modifications existing bundlers or ERC-4337 deployed contracts.

This is the PR for this new ERC: [ERC-4337 extension: New JSON-RPC APIs by forshtat · Pull Request #628 · ethereum/ERCs · GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/628)
