# Using ProofOfHumanity and neuralink as nodes

So given PoH as it is, I thought about a maybe “crazy” idea, would be possible with the current technology or future to use every person as a node/validator, so instead of PoW, PoS, it’s PoH, like a neurolink tech… That a chip is inserted in every registered Human of the poh registry, and this chip validates transactions, this is a long term idea, and lots of research should be done imo, and idk also if it will be a good idea, any thoughts?

Already asked to neuralink here: https://twitter.com/NachoBritos12/status/1428393406213107715?s=19
