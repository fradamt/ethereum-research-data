# Vyper.fun: CryptoZombies-like interactive learning resource for Vyper

Hey everyone!

Recently I started learning/exploring Vyper. As the Vyper community is still growing, we can benefit from some interactive learning resources.

A famous learning resource for solidity which has trained a lot of solidity developers is Cryptozombies. So, it would be a good idea to have a similar resource for Vyper.

Hence I started https://vyper.fun.

I’m looking for:

1. Contributors
2. Suggestions on Chapter topics. Right now my plan is to start with a Pokemon game: collect, breed, upgrade, battle, and trade pokemon.
