# Ethereum Master wallet and subaddresses implementation

In monero, all subaddresses generated by account have a same wallet. Why in ethereum all ether/tokens stored in sub-account address? Is there any way that we can store all ether/tokens in masters account?

You question is really unclear to me.

Many people use the same wallet (address) to store many assets (ETH/ERC20/ERC721/…)
