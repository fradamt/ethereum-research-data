**Ethernian** (2018-12-13):

Ok, guys!

I like to see so many optimists here!

PoS requires working SoV (storage of value) function of the money on stake.

How can a PoS defend the SoV function of the money on stake while being attacked economically?

Is there any in-depth discussion of PoS durability against an economically superior adversary (a state with money press)?
