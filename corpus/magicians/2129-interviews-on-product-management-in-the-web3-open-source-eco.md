# Interviews on product management in the web3 open source ecosystem

Following up on the previous ETHProduct community call ([#1 ETHProduct Community Call (Video + Notes) - #6 by pet3rpan](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/1-ethproduct-community-call-video-notes/2060/6)), I began to interview various PMs and teams within the web3 community in an attempt to gain a better grasp on the nuances of web3 open source product management vs. web 2.0 PMship.

**I tried to learn about the following…**

- Understand how they are structured and coordinated as a team
- Understand how have they improved coordination, what works / doesn’t work
- How do the teams make decisions?
- How do teams effectively communicate these decisions
- How much do ideological aversions influence the method of coordination
- What are teams currently trying to improve?
- How does your team attempt to diagnose and improve coordination and efficiency?

Initially so far, I have had fairly candid chats, recorded them in the process then made notes of the recordings afterwards. So far I have had a chat with…

- Jarrad (Status.im)
- Afri (Parity)
- Thibaut (Parity)
- Madeof_Tin (Tennagraph)
- Tim Beiko (PegaSys)
- Griff Green (Giveth)
- Tobias Schubotz (Gnosis)

**Here are notes transcribed and taken from the calls/chats I have so far…**

I guess the notes are still fairly rough and could be refined.

I believe we were talking about some people requiring more structure in the work environment. Not sure about ‘lots’, but apparently some folks left due to the anarchistic lack of structure and guided focus.
