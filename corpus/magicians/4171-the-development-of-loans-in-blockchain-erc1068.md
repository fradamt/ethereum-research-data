# The development of loans in Blockchain - ERC1068

Hi everyone,

I am Diego, currently a student of Law and Business in Madrid.

During the last months I have been very interested in the development of loans in Blockchain. I have been studying the **ERC1068** and companies like AAVE.

However, I think that we are far to discover de formula of a decentralized platform for the loans. Maybe because two problems:

- The necessity to identify the borrower and the lender.
- The necessity to keep a collateral.
So, if someone knows resources, information, or just want to share their opinion, let me know.

Thanks so much. ![:smiley:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9)
