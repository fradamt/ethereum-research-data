# Council of Paris - Token Ring

I have added some details to the Token Ring event during the Council of Paris with some suggested topics.

It is focused on using tokens to represent securities. There will also be a DeFi track at the conference with lots of related material and presentations (including myself).

Please add any topics you’d like to see discussed and your interest to the HackMD document at:
