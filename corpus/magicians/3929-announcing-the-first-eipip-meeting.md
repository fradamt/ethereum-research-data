# Announcing the First EIPIP Meeting

The first EIPIP (EIP Improvement Proposals) Zoom meeting will be this upcoming Wednesday at 15:00 UTC (10:00AM EST). The EIPIP meetings are meant to spark discussion to streamline/improve the EIP process as well as finding ways to attract new EIP editors. I may stream the call, but will definitely upload it to YouTube after. I welcome anyone to join the call. To participate in the discussion and get the call information reach out to me on Telegram ([@Souptacular](/u/souptacular)) and I’ll share the Telegram chat link.

[@anett](/u/anett) and I also both know the Telegram chat link if anyone is interested in participating. This link is kept private for the time being due to problems with spam in Telegram ![:cry:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/cry.png?v=9) .
