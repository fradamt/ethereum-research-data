# Alternative proposal for the Ethereum 2.0 serialization spec

Péter Szilágyi has proposed [Simple Offset Serialization (SOS)](https://gist.github.com/karalabe/3a25832b1413ee98daad9f0c47be3632), an alternative to the [Simple Serialize (SSZ)](https://github.com/ethereum/beacon_chain/tree/master/ssz) proposed in the Ethereum 2.0 spec.

There is a detailed Twitter discussion between [@karalabe](/u/karalabe), [@ricmoo](/u/ricmoo), and [@vbuterin](/u/vbuterin) about this proposal.
