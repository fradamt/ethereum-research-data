# Where to start? Reverse engineering EVM

Hi, I am working on a school project where I need to reverse engineer EVM. Specifically the go-ethereum repository. I have read through the yellow paper, just having trouble navigating through the go code. Any pointers or suggestions would be appreciated.

Well unfortunately I’m not the one who really could help you here - rather a counterquestion:

Which School are you attending where you can do such a project as school project? XD

I could not imagine any school where teachers would be competent enough for such a project, it’s straight out astonishing to me.
