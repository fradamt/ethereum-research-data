# First Call: Israel Regional Group

I think I’m going to take a shot at creating a regional Magicians group in Israel. Is there anyone else in the forum in the area who is interested?

I’m trying to draft a post on Medium. I’d appreciate it if anyone has the time to look at it and comment on what it might need. (I haven’t added contact info yet, I’ll do that before I post.) Here’s a link: https://medium.com/@w.s.schwab/a-call-to-open-a-regional-branch-of-the-fellowship-of-ethereum-magicians-in-israel-b62359c0e984

Read it. Looks like a good start.

Giving people some action to do beyond “get in touch” can be helpful. For instance - ask a question that you have about Ethereum and we’ll find the answer toghether. List topics you’re interested. Sign up here and introduce yourself.

Let us know how it goes!

Thanks for the feedback. I like your ideas, and plan on incorporating them. One question:

Any recommendations (from anyone) on a good app/site for this?

Depends on what you want to do. Do you want to run a meetup? Or more like a forum?

Spectrum https://spectrum.chat is worth checking out.

Or a simple Google Form signup before you make more decisions. Really depends on how you will get the word out in Israel.

Or use a thread here — you just need to be clear on what you want people to do.

I’m not sure what I want to run - I figured on adapting to the response. Google forms are a good idea. I could put the question to anyone willing to respond…

In the meantime, I published the Medium article (link above). We’ll see if it gets any response. If anyone wants to give my Tweet more visibility, it’s here: https://twitter.com/William94029369/status/1069875613215940608
