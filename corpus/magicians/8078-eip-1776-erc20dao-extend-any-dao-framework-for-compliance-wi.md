# EIP-1776 : ERC20DAO : Extend any DAO framework for compliance with local legal jurisdictions

Minimum viable DAOs for easy integration into various governance models that encourages a “Bring Your Own Governance” mentality.  The basic understanding being that we empower an admin to legally enact updates to token balances and NFT information as agreed upon by DAO.

This can be extended in many ways across other DAO models and adopts a set of naming patterns to extend systems default functions with their admin equivalents by appending “_admin” to all functions - in essence creating a “getter/setter” pattern that any other governance standard can integrate with.

title: Legal Governance Token Standard
description: Requires that a contract has an "owner", and that this owner has access to applicable functions so that it may easily enact the will of the DAO both on and off chain in any jurisdiction.

## Abstract
While there will be many DAO token standards and patterns to come, this will allow each one to be connected with a trusted third party -- for example a laywer to carry out the will of the DAO -- without requiring all to have the same underlying governance structure. Empowering a sort of "Bring Your Own Governance" mentality.

## Motivation
Introducing this legal link is a crucial component for the governance of real world assets.  When paired with local jurisdictions will give the ability of a DAO to do real world actions such as list an item for sale, coordinate transportation or handle other "in-person" tasks on behalf of the digital DAO.
