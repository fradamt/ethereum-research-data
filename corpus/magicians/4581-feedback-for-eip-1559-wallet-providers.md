# Feedback for EIP-1559: Wallet providers

[@timbeiko](/u/timbeiko) is gathering feedback from the community to understand needs, impacts, and constraints relating to EIP-1559. In the spirit of this I created this thread for public posting from stakeholders at wallet providers, but definitely reach out to him directly as well.
