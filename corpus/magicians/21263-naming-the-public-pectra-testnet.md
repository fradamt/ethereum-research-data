# Naming the public Pectra testnet

**Please help name the Pectra testnet!**

[@parithosh](/u/parithosh) announced plans for a named Pectra testnet to run during Devcon at [All Core Devs - Consensus (ACDC) #143, October 3 2024](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/all-core-devs-consensus-acdc-143-october-3-2024/21155)

The testnet plans to use the same spec as upcoming [Pectra-devnet-4](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/pectra-devnet-4).

### Naming requirements

- It should roughly have something to do with the fork/location of event/location of launching of network
- It NEEDS to be hard to pronounce
- It can optionally have a difficult spelling
- It can optionally be easy to look up online (SEO)

Bonus: It ideally has a related emoji (for use on social media)

### Naming Proposals

| Testnet Name | Reasoning |
| --- | --- |
| MooDeng | Pectra was going to the be our largest upgrade ever (Hippo ) but since the split into Pectra & Fusaka it is now much smaller (a pygmy version of its former self).  Out of Africa (Africa interop) and born in Thailand (Devcon SEA). |
| Khlong | It stands for Thai canals and the Khlong Toei station is also close to where Devcon is held |
| Mekong | It’s a river that passes through a large part of SE Asia and connects 5 out of the 11 countries there |
| KrungThep | Bangkok local name |
| PectraBang | Pectra + Bangkok |
| Bangnet |  |
| Sawasdee | “Hello” in Thai is Sawasdee (pronounced “sow-at-deee”) which feels like it might be hard enough to pronounce, but also after devcon there might be a critical mass of people able to educate the broader community on it. |
| Ratchadaphisek | The devcon venue is on Ratchadaphisek Road, in the Khlong Toei district |
| Benchakitti | The devcon venue is next door to Benchakitti Park. |

**Vote for public Pectra testnet name** (for signaling purposes only)

- MooDeng
- Khlong
- Mekong
- KrungThep
- PectraBang

amazing suggestion ![:smiley:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=12)

Just to put the naming requirements for a testnet clear:

- It should roughly have something to do with the fork/location of event/location of launching of network
- It NEEDS to be hard to pronounce
- It can optionally have a difficult spelling
- It can optionally be easy to look up online (SEO)

I love the MooDeng name, perhaps we can have a vote once we have some suggestions?

The current options we brainstormed in the team:

- Khlong testnet, it stands for thai canals and the Khlong Toei station is also close to where devcon is held
- Mekong testnet, Its a river that passes through a large part of SE Asia and connects 5 out of the 11 countries there

I can add a poll next week with any suggestions.

Awesome! Here are some ideas:

1. KrungThep testnet. Local name for Bangkok, hard enough to pronounce.
2. PectraBang testnet. Pectra + Bangkok, sounds funny
3. Bangnet. Very easy.

Am loving the requirement that the name should be hard to pronounce.

“Hello” in Thai is `Sawasdee` (pronounced “sow-at-deee”) which feels like it might be *hard enough* to pronounce, but also after devcon there might be a critical mass of people able to educate the broader community on it.

The devcon venue is on `Ratchadaphisek` Road, in the `Khlong Toei` district (I see that [@parithosh](/u/parithosh) already proposed that). It is also next door to `Benchakitti` Park.

Thanks for the suggestions [@juliaaschmidt](/u/juliaaschmidt).  Unfortunately I can’t edit a poll once it has started.

**matt** (2024-10-11):

fortunately there is only one right answer

**abcoathup** (2024-10-11):

I’m pretty pleased with my suggestion.

I also like that it could be MoodEng, Mood Engineering to make me happy that we have a Pectra public testnet for Devcon.

The case against using it: I found out there is a memecoin with the same name. ![:cry:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/cry.png?v=12)

[Update: closed the topic as it was discovered by memecoiners]
