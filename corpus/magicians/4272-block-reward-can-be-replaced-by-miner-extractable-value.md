# Block reward can be replaced by miner extractable value

Miner extractable value is not the problem or a danger; it is potentially the end of inflation. We can stop issuance completely if miners can make enough from MEV. Better than eradicating this revenue or expending resources to identify and quantify it generally (which may be impossible).
