# ERC-6809 Draft: Non-Fungible Key Bound Token (NFKBT)

A standard interface for Non-Fungible Key Bound Tokens, also known as a **NFKBT**

The Key Bound Token Standard is a new standard focused on self-custodial security. The users of the non-fungible version can benefit from its integrated decentralized anti-theft mechanism. By binding two additional wallets, this standard prevents attackers and scammers alike to use your asset, even if they gain control of your seed phrase or private key.

[PR-6809](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6809)
