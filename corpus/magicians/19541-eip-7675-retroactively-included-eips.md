Curious to hear thoughts on

1. Could we use ‘Unconventionally’ or ‘Atypically’ instead of ‘Retroactively’ or any synonym to clarify that these EIPs were added asynchronously and were not part of any network upgrade?
2. Could this be categorized as Informational instead of Draft given this EIP is adding information similar to  EIP-2982: Serenity Phase 0 or EIP-6953: Network Upgrade Activation Triggers and not a Meta EIP for a particular upgrade?

I’m fine with:

- Retroactively: this was the terminology used in All Core Devs
- Meta EIP: upgrade EIPs are meta, so adding EIPs to Ethereum as part of an upgrade or retroactively should all be Meta.
