## Simple Summary
This EIP modifies ethash in order to break ASIC miners specialized for the current ethash mining algorithm.

## Abstract
This EIP pursue "obsolete current ASIC miners" by modifying PoW algorithm in a very low risk manner and update to latest hash algorithm from deprecated FNV Hash algorithms.

Following TEthashV1 algorithm suggests safe transition of PoW algorithms and secure the FNV Algorithm in MIX Parts.

## Motivation

EIP-1485 discussion.

TETHashV1 (Trust Ethash Version 1) : ethash PoW algorithm upgrade for preventing the ETH-Asic devices.

and more securing the Mix parts / Dag parts algorithm.
