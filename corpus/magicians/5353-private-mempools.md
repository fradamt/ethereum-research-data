# Private mempools

How do people feel about the existence of private mempools like taichi.network?  Would you actively support or oppose them, or be neutral?

On one hand, they feel a bit shady to me, perhaps because they move toward a two-tier network where some people have an unfair advantage over others.  One might counter that the service is available to anyone who is willing to pay for it, but it still doesn’t feel very good.

On the other hand, they provide a valuable service by solving a problem (frontrunning) for users.

**lightcycle** (2021-02-17):

I am for an open mempool

But to highlight the extremes, currently front-runners must run nodes in multiple geographic locations to not miss transactions.  One could argue that nodes in one geographic location next to a mining pool is acceptable, even though it is a “geographic local network”

Then this begs the question: where do we draw the line?

Not easy to answer.

So although I do use the public mempool, I cannot find fault in private mempools
