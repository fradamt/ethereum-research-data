Hey um… there was a lot of momentum and positive energy behind this ring, but when we switched from communicating asynchronously on the forum to trying to schedule a call people spent more time trying talking about their schedules than the CoC. The GitHub repo hasn’t had activity in over a month, neither has the [CoC Thread](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethmagicians-council-of-prague-integrity-ring-community-code-of-conduct/2836/34), and I haven’t seen anything from the email list lately.

Am I missing something and/or would it be better to go back to communicating async on the forum and GitHub?
