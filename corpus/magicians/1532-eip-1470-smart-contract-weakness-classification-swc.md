# EIP-1470: Smart Contract Weakness Classification (SWC)

Hey everyone. We have been working on an EIP that proposes a classification scheme for security weaknesses in Ethereum smart contracts and it be great to get feedback. You can find the draft here https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1469.

Also we are looking for contributors who are interested on working on SWC-registry at https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry. We have currently 25 smart contract weakness  variants documented and close to 50 test samples on there. The repo is also published on Github Pages https://smartcontractsecurity.github.io/SWC-registry/.
