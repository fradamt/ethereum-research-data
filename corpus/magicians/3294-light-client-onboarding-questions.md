# Light Client Onboarding Questions

I am conducting light client implementation research, and would like advice for familiarisation of the high level components of the light client, and best strategy for doing so.

I have familiarised myself with [LES](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/les.md) documentation but only see it as an entry point into understanding the protocol.

My questions vary from;

- What is the best client to refer to in order to obtain the protocol implementation, and therefore ascertain what is needed to be developed; would this be go-ethereum or the third party Parity client for example?
- Is there concrete documentation available on the components that make the protocol beyond the LES documentation?
- The most efficient strategy for developing the light client, leveraging what is out there already.

Clarification to these concerns will also be beneficial for newcomers wanting to endeavour into the protocols.

Thanks in advance.
