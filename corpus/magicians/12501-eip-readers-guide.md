# EIP Reader's Guide

We have a guide for editors, and a guide for authors is WIP. How about a guide for people that read EIPs? It would contain stuff like “only final EIPs should be used”, and brief descriptions of each of the sections.

I think this is a good idea.

Another thing: while reading an EIP, check the discussion thread for debate that leads to this final version for more awareness
