Could you remove these posts and start over as a human user? This Forum is mainly for discussion of Ethereum-related proposals and standards. This WP Smart Contracts project, if legitimate, is interesting and probably uses numerous standards, and you can more effectively get our attention by asking for feedback or contributing to discussions (rather than promote it directly).
