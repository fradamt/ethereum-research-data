We will close community track suggestions by the end of this week (September 22, 2024) and finalize the CFP, allowing people to start officially applying through the website.

Feel free to submit your topic ideas—it could be the easiest way to become a track creator! !

Before submiting make sure to check [EthereumZuri.ch 2025 - Industry :: pretalx](https://cfp.ducttape.events/ethereumzuri-ch-2025/cfp) and [EthereumZuri.ch 2025 - Research & Academia :: pretalx](https://cfp.ducttape.events/ethereumzurich2025academia/cfp) to avoid doublons !

Perfect! Thank you for posting this [@nicocsgy](/u/nicocsgy)

Ideal case scenario is that the Ethereum Magicians will take over one full stage for the entire conference - and would facilitate community topics and discussion - with full liberty of what content will be picked here.

One stage dedicated to academia

One stage dedicated to industry

One stage dedicated to community

Nit: Isn’t accessibility more of a [W3C thing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/) than an [IETF thing](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/biasws/about/)? I spent the last year doing some automated testing work based on the W3C accessibility testing-design methodology and found it super helpful once I got over the hump (there’s a bit of a learning curve with the terminology and the style).  Combining that with the [wallet testing framework](https://github.com/wallet-test-framework/framework) could be super interesting and i’d be very curious what people come up with in the way of test CASE DESIGN (even if they don’t get as far as test TOOLING or runners).  Anyone working on this may also be interested in some of the Human-Computer Interaction and UX bibliography in the notes of the [CASA secure design working group](https://github.com/chainagnostic/secure-design). Feel free to ping me here or on github if any teams take up these topics!

**EugeRe** (2024-12-04):

Hey [@nicocsgy](/u/nicocsgy) i would like to speak about this research, which combine zk for contract accounts!

Do you think I am still on time for that?

Thanks!

**Eniko** (2024-12-11):

Hey Euge Re,

You can still submit a proposal! If your session is based on a research paper you have authored or co-authored (either published or pending publication), please submit it in the Research/Academia track—you’ll need to provide the paper for review for the session to be accepted. If your proposal isn’t based on your research, please submit it in the Industry track. ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=15)

You can use the following link to submit:
