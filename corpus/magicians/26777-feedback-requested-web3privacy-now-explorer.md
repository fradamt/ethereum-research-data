# Feedback requested: Web3Privacy Now Explorer

Hello,

We are [Web3PrivacyNow](https://web3privacy.info/) have built the [web3privacy Now explorer](https://explorer.web3privacy.info/). It’s a dashboard with scoring metrics for all different types of privacy projects. ***We’re looking for feedback from the community on the explorer***. We’re looking for any critiques to help us make the explorer a better resource for the public and its users. Check out the explorer and let us know what you think.  https://explorer.web3privacy.info.

Here is some more information about the explorer.

We’ve been influenced by projects like [L2BEAT](https://l2beat.com/), [Ethproofs](https://ethproofs.org/) [Getting started with ETH](https://ethereum.org/en/start/), and [Walletbeat](https://beta.walletbeat.eth.limo/).

**Our goals** ![:spiral_notepad:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/spiral_notepad.png?v=12) ![:memo:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/memo.png?v=12)

- Free resource for users, forever
- Offer valuable information as a dashboard for a wide variety of users
- Projects should find it valuable to have their project listed on the explorer (increased visibility within the entire explorer user base)

**Explorer features**

- 770+ projects across 5+ ecosystems
- Open collaboration (anyone can submit projects or edit projects)
- Easy to read privacy scoring pie charts
- Card display for individual projects
- 5 different general privacy categories (Openness, technology, privacy, security, audits)

**Features we’re actively working on for the future:**

- LLM data crawler (to simplify data input)
- OSINT and static code analysis
- Add RSS feeds for individual projects to add their own curated news or articles
- Add realtime TVL data for individual projects and separate chart for ALL Privacy projects
- W3PN explorer AI chatbot (Inspired by Aztec AI)
- Deeper research on specific projects to offer better insight into higher scoring/more active projects

**Further resources for potential features:**

- Roadmap features/issues on Github
- Privacy explorer forum discussion
