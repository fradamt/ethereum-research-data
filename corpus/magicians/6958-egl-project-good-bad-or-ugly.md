# EGL project: good, bad or ugly?

Really strange news today about EGL project, especially having that looks like it is supported by Coinlist and major VCs.

Should it be considered as an attempt to improve ETH or a hostile takeover?

      No. That's how you let bad behavior take roots. Seriously though, a community always has a tendency to diverge on external pressure and you either oppose, or there's no way back. Many projects failed like this. It's not a joke, this is a serious issue.
