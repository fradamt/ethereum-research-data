# secureETH Meetup notees - "Trustlessness in Blockchain"

Trustlessness in Blockchain:

**Problem:**

1. Everyone uses OnlyOwner as their only form of Access control
2. Users do not know what trust system the application they are using employ

**Approach:**

1. Defining Trust - Setting precise attributes & terms (U2U & U2O & O2O)
2. Communication about the Trust
3. Dynamic rules of trust breakdown
4. Security & consequences
5. Implementation (Cross system Trust management)
6. Trusting the bridges & Oracles that connect the platforms
7. Address Disaster Recovery

**Solution:**

1. Access Control = Big Problem
2. Weights on functions that makes & breaks the contract
3. Etherscan integration

**Trust parameters(ongoing exploration):**

- Upgrades to the contract
- Access Control (Admin)
- Special Privilege
