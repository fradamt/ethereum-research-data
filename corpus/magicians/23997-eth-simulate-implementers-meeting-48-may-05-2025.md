### Meeting Summary:

No summary overview available

**Click to expand detailed summary**

In the meeting, Sina and Killari discussed the status of their project, including a bug fix and the need for further testing. They also considered merging their meeting with another one, but were unsure about the time. Sina expressed the importance of getting all tests passing before merging the spec and test. They also discussed the need for more updates from Netamount and Beijel. The conversation ended with Sina planning to contact Beijel after a release.

### Next Steps:

- Sina to ping Be suit to review the tests after the release of the bug fix in cath.
- Killari to explore the possibility of merging this meeting with the RPC Standards meeting.
- Sina to continue work on estimate gas and tracing after Petra (in 2 days).
- Killari to check the status of Besu’s implementation and its closeness to Geth.
- Sina to follow up on getting two clients (possibly Geth and Besu) to fully agree on the spec and tests for merging.
