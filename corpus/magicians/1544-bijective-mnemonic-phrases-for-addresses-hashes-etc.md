# Bijective Mnemonic Phrases for addresses, hashes, etc

I hope this is not off-topic.

When doing data analysis on the blockchain, I have to deal with a lot of addresses. Trying to remember and discern them gives me headaches. I tried to offer a solution here:

I need your feedback on this.

There is also an issue: The first word of most mnemonics start with the letter ‘a’, which kind of defeats the purpose. This is not due to an error, 20 byte addresses fall into a range where the base conversion results in this accumulation for the first word. I have a few solutions in mind, but first would like to hear your opinion.
