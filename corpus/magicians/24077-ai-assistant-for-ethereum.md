# AI Assistant for Ethereum

Apologies in advance for the sales pitch.

From discovery to first project, new blockchain developers face fragmented resources, steep learning curves, complex setups, and sparse mentorship

(*source: [ethereum-magicians.org](http://ethereum-magicians.org)* ). These pain points contribute to high dropout rates and highlight the need for better onboarding support.

We’ve built **Bytebell** , an AI-powered DevRel Copilot purpose-built for crypto ecosystems. It ingests your GitHub repos, docs, whitepapers, and even forum threads or diagrams—then returns precise, context-aware answers to developer queries via chat.

Bytebell is already cutting support load and onboarding time by up to **80%** in projects working with stacks like Solidity, Move, and ZK tech.

You can try it live:

• [sui.bytebell.ai](https://sui.bytebell.ai)

• [caldera.bytebell.ai](https://caldera.bytebell.ai)

We’re now planning to build the same for Ethereum. We’d love your feedback—especially on what sources beyond EIPs, the Ethereum GitHub, and EVM docs we should ingest.

Hello, [@GraphicalDot](/u/graphicaldot)

I haven’t seen your product, but as a feedback on sources, I can recommend ingesting on rollups docs and GitHubs, like Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Scroll, Linea, etc., since they are a very important part of the ecosystem. Also, many of them overlap with your pre-existing support on ZK tech.

It is a very good idea to mix Ethereum with AI. We are currently at the heart of an AI industrial revolution.

In particular, I’m sure smart contracts could be used to pilot AI agents.
