Definitely need a concrete plan for testing each one of these ideas either atomically or after successfully proving any prerequisites. This is a much more complex proposal from Casper FFG, and requires more solid planning.

For example, the random beacon chain *could* be something useful for a variety of games that require a source of randomness. Many different low stake use cases can show robustness before the entire network moves to the new design.
