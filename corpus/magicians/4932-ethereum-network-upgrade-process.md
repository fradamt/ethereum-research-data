# Ethereum Network Upgrade Process

After spending a few months collecting feedbacks, questions/concerns, and evaluating the current process of the Ethereum mainnet upgrade, the [EIPIP group](https://github.com/ethereum-cat-herders/EIPIP) recommended some changes to improve the **Network Upgrade Process**.

I’ve [drafted a blog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZLOg0mWH8vzXX_3KbWCoHZHuPOfyZR8dA9BcE5z4nk/edit#) explaining the new process. This will be shared on the [Ethereum Cat Herders Medium](https://medium.com/ethereum-cat-herders) to make it more accessible.

[@MadeofTin](/u/madeoftin) and I will be joining the [All Core Devs meeting #100](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/221) to give a walkthrough (if time permits) and answer any questions.

This looks awesome, thanks [@poojaranjan](/u/poojaranjan)!  I *really* like that the mainnet block number isn’t set until *after* the successful fork on the testnets, it makes the mainnet fork less a “fait accompli” and more something everyone can actually feel confident in.
