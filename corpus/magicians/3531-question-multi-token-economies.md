# Question: multi-token economies

Hello Magicians,

Is there any patterns how to create a workflows spawning many projects with multiple independent tokens effectively?

we all have to pay gas with eth while sending tokens (2 token economy), which is already a pain.

But (just for example) what if I would like to create a transaction paying referrals with BAT which should send some other tokens like (MKR+DAI) to close a CDP?

Any convenient patterns known?

UX friendly, atomic, flexible to combine…

Thanks!
