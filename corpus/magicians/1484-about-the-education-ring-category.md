# About the Education Ring category

For discussions about the direction and process flow for knowledge management in the Ethereum ecosystem.

The three main directives will be to help with:

1. Educating ourselves (those currently in the Ethereum community)
2. Educating the rest of the world (either devs or non technical community)
3. How we bring devs to opensource (grow the technical engagement of Ethereum)

For more information, please see the [Education Ring wiki page](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Education-Ring).
