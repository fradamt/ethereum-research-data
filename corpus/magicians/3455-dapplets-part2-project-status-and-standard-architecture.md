# Dapplets: part2 - project status and standard architecture

Hello friends,

I was quite silent here because I am working on [Dapplets Project](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/dapplets-rethinking-dapp-architecture-for-better-adoption-and-security/2799) now.

We have implemented some new cool stuff and made (may be controversial?) decision choices.

Before the current development phase gets finalized, I would very appreciate all your thought and any feedback.

Please find the main article here:

[Dapplets (part 2): implementation details and development status](http://bit.ly/dapplets-part2-implementation)

thank you!
