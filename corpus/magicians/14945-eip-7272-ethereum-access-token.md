# EIP-7272: Ethereum Access Token

Hi everyone!

We looked around and couldn’t find a standard way to give transaction authorizations to users from an off-chain service, so here’s a proposal for something we call *Ethereum Access Tokens* (or EATs for short). We’ve been successfully using them in production for months now.

They’re loosely analogous to movie tickets. When you go to a movie theater, you’re usually handed a ticket to enter a specific room, for a specific movie and the ticket isn’t valid past a certain time.

We’d love some feedback from the community!
