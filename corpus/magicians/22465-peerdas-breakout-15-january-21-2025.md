## AI summary ()

The PeerDAS Breakout Room #15 covers updates from various teams working on Ethereum’s development, focusing on progress, challenges, and future testing strategies.

### Client Updates

Lighthouse has made significant progress, including full readiness for interrupt testing and running the latest Electro code. However, a state route mismatch issue arose during transitions to full [4:01]. Manu reported implementing a custody group count and working on the C library, which still requires optimization [5:01]. The Prism team is also addressing a state truth mismatch and is in the early stages of implementing validator custody [5:50].

### Decoupling and Testing

The teams are focused on decoupling custody groups and preparing for integration testing. The Grandin team is moving the P code activation into full and stress testing their reconstruction flow [7:35]. The discussion highlighted the need for thorough integration testing before moving to the next development phase [12:27].

### Development Specifications

The current DEET spec is under review, with teams encouraged to track progress on custody-related pull requests. The consensus spec version has been updated to ensure compatibility with the latest changes [10:15].

### Future Steps

The next steps involve all teams working on local testing and interrupt testing with other clients. The goal is to ensure all scenarios are covered and to prepare for a definitive test in the coming weeks [29:15].

In conclusion, the breakout room emphasized collaboration among teams to address challenges, optimize processes, and ensure a smooth transition to the next development phase.
