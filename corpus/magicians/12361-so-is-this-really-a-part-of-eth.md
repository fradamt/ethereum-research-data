# So. Is this really a part of eth?

Okinami token, okinamitoken on Twitter claims to be a token connected to the Ethereum Surge. It has characteristic traits like connection to Genesis & Russell Verbeeten on Etherscan. Theories are it could be a zk rollup. Is this real or yet another scam rug?

Thank you.

Anyone can claim that they are building a rollup, they may also deliver or not deliver on their claims.  Their website doesn’t appear to make any claims and is just a link to their token with an unspecified purpose.
