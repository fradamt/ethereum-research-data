# Should external links be allowed/prohibited/restricted?

Hi editors and authors who care about links, there is an active discussion about an Editing policy whether to allow/prohibit/restrict external links from an EIP. I love to bring this to your attention and invite you to voice your opinions because I think the referencability of EIPs are important to the culture and technical composability of future EIP.

Here it is the thread [Advocate for EIP editors to clearly explain the **current** external link policy to new authors. · Issue #5597 · ethereum/EIPs · GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/5597)
