# Front-end for Subdomains Regstrar

I tried looking online for a good place to sell subdomains. Most forums simply point to the contract on etherscan, telling you to use that. Wouldn’t it be better if we could improve that UX process with an intuitive portal similar to the [website](https://app.ens.domains/) for the domains themselves?

Suggest posting in the ENS forum.  I am not sure if you can currently sell a subdomain without the domain holder being able to change ownership:
