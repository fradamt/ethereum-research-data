# EIP friends, anyone going to ETHDenver 2023

Friends, I am planning to go to ETHDenver, just wanna start a thread about who is also going and maybe we could meet up there.

We are planning to host NFT Dev meetup and would love to get some EIP authors to present their EIPs!

Let us know if you are going!

**xinbenlv** (2023-01-04):

I also love to signup to the NFT Dev Meetup, where is the proper way to signup to attend and maybe give some quick talk to evangelize people for some open source project ideas? [@anett](/u/anett)

**xinbenlv** (2023-01-04):

That’s nice. So are you going to be there during the #BUIDLWeek as well? [@ReiSoleil](/u/reisoleil)

I’m in the process of securing venue, will share details later.

Btw will prioritise NFT Standards WG members to join the event

**anett** (2023-01-11):

The best category for this topic is “Happenings” as happenings = meetups, events. Feel free to tag it as ETH Denver

---

**xinbenlv** (2023-01-11):

Thanks for the answering! Tagged!

---

**anett** (2023-01-11):

Eth Magicians will definitely host some fun event in Denver this year and we will do our best to curate the speakers and attendees in order to provide the pure Eth Magicians vibes ![:sparkles:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12) !
