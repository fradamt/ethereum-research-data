# IDEA: A Standardized Interface for On-chain Exchanges

# Problem

Currently almost every on-chain exchange has their own interface to execute operations on exchange. Currently creating platforms supporting different on-chain exchanges is hard and supporting all of them is almost impossible since new on-chain exchanges also create their own interface.

# Proposed Solution

A standard interface to be used with current and future on-chain exchanges. Current exchanges can create a new smart contract with provided interface standard and future on-chain exchanges can support use the standardized interface.
