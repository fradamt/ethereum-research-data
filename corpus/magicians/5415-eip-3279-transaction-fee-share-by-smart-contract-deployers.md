# EIP-3279: Transaction fee share by smart contract deployers

A lot of smart contract developers are not able to capture any value from their widely used smart contracts, and are thus forced to deploy meaningless tokens in order to be able to do so. If developers get a small share of all the fees generated by users interacting with their smart contracts, it will potentially solve the aforementioned problem. In addition, it will provide huge incentives for developers to choose Ethereum over other platforms for their applications.

I’ve already submitted EIP-3279 here: [eip-draft-smartcontract-fee-share: Transaction fee share by smart contract deployers by tarekskr · Pull Request #3279 · ethereum/EIPs · GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/3279/files)

Would really appreciate it if someone is able to help me formalize the technical side of this EIP (specification, security considerations, etc.) ![:pray:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/pray.png?v=9)
