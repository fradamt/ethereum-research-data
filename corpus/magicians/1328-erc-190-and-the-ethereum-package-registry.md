# ERC-190 and the Ethereum Package Registry

I wanted to point out that [EthPM registry](https://www.ethpm.com/registry) does not have very many smart contracts registered. It is on Ropsten, perhaps this has something to do with the low adoption, but it may also be a lack of awareness. Is there a way we can increase visibility, or better promote the use of package management?
