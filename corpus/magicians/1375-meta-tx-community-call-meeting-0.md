# Meta-tx Community Call/Meeting 0

Since the creation of ERC-1077/1078, we figured out that we can do somepretty cool things with delegated execution of meta-txs. Many projects have sprung up surrounding this. So far we have had little communication between projects. There is a lot to be gained in doing so as we seem to all face similar challenges and issues.

We will be having a meeting with the following agenda: [MetaTx Crew Agenda - Meeting 0 - HackMD](https://hackmd.io/-fF2VKIFRzyiWaxVQAh0wA?view)

All details will be kept and updated there. Cheers! Talk soon ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)
