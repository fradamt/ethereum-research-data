# Ping a ring from a post

Is it possible to ping a ring from a post?

E.g. I think it would make sense to ping the wallet ring about this EIP: [Temporal Replay Protection](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/temporal-replay-protection/2355)

But I do not see a way currently to do so - the only way I see is making a post linking to the post above with the category wallet ring. But this does not feel right.

We may be able to do this via “user groups”, I will open it up when I get a chance. It may require someone to look after the group membership in this Discourse setup though.

This is for a @ligi suggestion for messaging members of a particular ring inside[…]() of FEM Forum messages.

Group membership can be set so anyone can join or remove themselves.

The [@council-volunteers](/groups/council-volunteers) is an example of a group that people can add / remove to on their own – and I’m actually pinging 22 people by @-mentioning that ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)

So [@ligi](/u/ligi) just ask for what group you want created and it should solve what you want to do.

I wanted to ping all wallet-developers. So a group for the wallet developers ring would be nice. But perhaps we should make it more general and have groups for all rings.

Yes, see [Github issue #14](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/issues/14) where I first suggested it ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)
