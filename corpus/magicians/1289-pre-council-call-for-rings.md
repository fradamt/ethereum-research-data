# Pre Council Call For Rings

Hello Magicians!

[@noot](/u/noot) and I are excited to be helping out with the Council of Prague, specifically as ring wranglers. We’re trying to get an idea of what rings will be participating and who will be participating in what ring. To do this we have put together a [hackmd document](https://hackmd.io/DaJhrasLQteUk3IwX5bQAg#) that we hope people will fill out accordingly.  If you have any questions please post them here.

Thanks!
