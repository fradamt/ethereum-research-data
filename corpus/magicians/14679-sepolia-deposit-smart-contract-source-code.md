# Sepolia deposit smart contract source code

Does someone have the source code for the [Sepolia deposit smart contract](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x7f02c3e3c98b133055b8b348b2ac625669ed295d#code)? It’s not verified on Etherscan, and a few attempts at a web search and search of likely places in Github didn’t turn up anything. Thanks!

According to [@parithosh_j](https://twitter.com/parithosh_j) it is a variant of this repo: [GitHub - protolambda/testnet-dep-contract: Testnet deposit contract for Eth2 - permissioned, tokens, drain, admin funcs. DO NOT USE ON MAINNET.](https://github.com/protolambda/testnet-dep-contract)
