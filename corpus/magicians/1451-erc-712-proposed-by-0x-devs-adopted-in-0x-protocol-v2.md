# ERC-712, proposed by 0x devs, adopted in 0x Protocol v2

> Hate it when you’re about to sign a message, but you’re unable to read the message you’re signing? So do we! That’s why 0x’s very own Leonid Logvinov and Remco Bloemen wrote EIP-712, a standard for hashing structured data, and why we’re adding support for it in V2.
