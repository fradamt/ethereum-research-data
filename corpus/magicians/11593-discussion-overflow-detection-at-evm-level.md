# Discussion: Overflow detection at evm level

Hi everyone, I’m working in a proposal to bring overflow, underflow ad division by zero checking to evm level,

It was sugested to create a discussion here before publishing the EIP itself,

Has any discussion happened on this subject?

I recommend reviewing the work on [EIP-1041](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1051).

Thank you, I still believe in bringing math checking to EVM, this existing EIP an execelent material to work on
