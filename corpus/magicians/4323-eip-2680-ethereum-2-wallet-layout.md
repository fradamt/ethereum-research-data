# EIP 2680 Ethereum 2 wallet layout

It’s good! And maybe you can help Ethereum wallets a little more. ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9)

My team has submitted an EIP for [Saving and Displaying Image Onchain for Universal Tokens](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2569). And we’ve even developed a little site to show how it actually works: https://DHonor.io. Then we found many wallet users were confused cause no wallet could show SVG image(image of ERC-721 token) from Ethereum.

May we work together to figure out an EIP to help wallets?
