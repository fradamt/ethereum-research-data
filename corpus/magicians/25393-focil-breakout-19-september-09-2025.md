### Meeting Summary:

The team discussed development updates, focusing on rebase efforts and client integrations. Jihoon noted that feature specs were hidden but will have a separate section from canonical ones. Pelle reported progress on the first EIP interrupt between Rath and Gath, and Katya added new metrics but plans to discuss further next week. The team addressed issues with running Lodestar on top of Ethereum, with Katya and Jihoon agreeing to investigate further. They also confirmed that the latest client images are available in Jihoon’s repository, with the old version recommended for Lodestar testing. The conversation ended with an acknowledgment of team members being busy with EIPs and Fusica, and the next meeting was scheduled for two weeks.

### Next Steps:

- Jihoon to follow up with Justin about making feature specs visible in a separate section on the website
- Jihoon to try the interop between Lodestar and Geth on top of Fluffy to investigate the engine API error Katya encountered
- Katya to take a deeper look into the engine API issue occurring during transition from Fluffy to EIP
- Katya to open a PR in the metrics repo after discussing and reaching agreement on metrics
- NC to look into the Lodestar engine API issue

### Hidden FOCIL Spec

Currently, FOCIL spec is hidden on the CL spec website. This is to distinguish experiments from canonical specs. Feature specs, including the FOCIL spec, would have their own section separate from the canonical ones soon.

### Implementation Updates

- Lodestar has been working on rebasing onto Fulu.
- Reth has been working on interop with CL clients.
