# Name needed for combined EL + CL (Prague + Electra) upgrade

A name is needed for the combined EL + CL upgrade (Prague + Electra) after Dencun (Cancun + Deneb) upgrade.

EL upgrade is **Prague** (Devcon city)

CL upgrade was named **Electra** on [ACDC call 113](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/823#issuecomment-1635053770)

Suggestions so far for Prague + Electra:

- Petra
- Pectra
- Practra/Prectra/Pretra/Pektra
- Pralectra
- Electrague
- Elegue
- Prague-Electra
- E-Prague
- PragEl

Please reply with your suggestions, then we can run a poll.

Prague-Electra.

Willing to die on this hill.

Anything but “Electrague” is fine by me ![:rofl:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/rofl.png?v=12)

**Demuirgos** (2023-07-20):

what about  “Practra” or “Prectra”?

---

**matt** (2023-07-20):

I like Petra. (extra characters to appease the forum software)

---

**RenanSouza2** (2023-07-20):

I suggest Practra for the name

---

**sullof** (2023-07-20):

I like **Petra**.

Or the opposite, **Elegue**.

> Petra

This one. It was never chosen because it was the shortest.

**shemnon** (2023-07-21):

[Petra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra) is a fairly famous place in Jordan.  If we want a unique moniker like Shapella or Dencun we would need to add more letters or switch the order.

From that constraint **Pretra** and **Pektra** would be my recommendations.

We could swizzle the names, but Prelektrague will be a nightmare to type.

**mattstam** (2023-07-22):

+1 for Petra – simplest and easiest to pronounce for different language speakers.

---

**arbora** (2023-07-22):

Throwing **Prelec** into the ring as being short and capturing the key sounds of both words, without getting too hung up on cramming the literal ending of one or the other in.

Petra is short and sweet, but an actual place (that didn’t host Devcon), unlike previous novel contractions Shapella and Dencun.

**aka** (2023-07-23):

I asked chat GPT to recommend a word by combining ‘Prague’ + ‘Electra’ and was offered as below:

**1. Praglectra**

2. Pragelect

3. Elecrague

4. Elecpra

**DoubleB.eth** (2023-07-23):

How about “PralecTricity”?

---

**realHakeen** (2023-07-24):

**Pragtra Pragtra Pragtra Pragtra Pragtra**

---

**radek** (2023-07-25):

Prague-Electra

Nice opportunity to stop those strange combined names.

---

**mkalinin** (2023-07-27):

Suggesting E-Prague if we want any shortcut to exist, while I am more on Prague-Electra and  interchangeability of these names.

---

**sand** (2023-07-28):

Pragel (or PragEl)

Simple, short and easy to say ![:wink:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12)

**abcoathup** (2024-01-05):

[@matt](/u/matt) named Prague + Electra upgrade as Pectra on all core devs - execution 178
