# Banners / Pins for protocol calls

Hey [@abcoathup](/u/abcoathup),

Let’s have the discsussion around protocol calls banners / pins here !

I did bulk move the [acd](/tag/acd) and [breakout](/tag/breakout) to [Protocol Calls & happenings](/c/protocol-calls/63) and pinned the next breakout. I was wondering if the banner is not a bit too much for all the procotol calls. For context having a banner post will place a banner on all pages until dismissed by the user. It could be interesting to promote ACDs but as we have many protocol calls the banner would be rotating quite fast.

Maybe we could have something that aligns with the hierarchy of the calls with [acd](/tag/acd) being the most important one then rollcall then breakouts. Like banners for ACDs and pins for the rest, any opinion [@timbeiko](/u/timbeiko) ?

We should experiment to see what works/doesn’t work regards pinning/banners.

We should focus on community calls & [breakout](/tag/breakout).  Specifically where we are trying to engage the community, so we want to make the most noise, e.g. prior to network upgrade planning, Future EOA/AA.

[acd](/tag/acd) calls get the most focus and have the most resources around them (live stream, summary, writeups, podcasts etc.), but they are the main location to view Ethereum governance at work.

Also depends how much capacity you have.

We should also close protocol call topics soon after they have happened, and direct users to discuss in upcoming calls.

Doesn’t look like I have permission to close a topic.

Hey, totally agree let’s experiment. I think a site wide pinning for the next call would be great the banner looks a bit cheap in my opinion.

I’m actively looking into giving you the proper permissions would be indeed better to have the topic closed after the calls.

So I just removed the banner that was there for years. And globally pinned the next ACD. IMO globally pin is the good setting for protocol calls as of now. It doesn’t spam all the pages.

A topic pinned globally will appear at the top of the topics list (aka `/latest` page).

On the `/categories` page it will appear *at the top of its own category* but will not appear in the other categories.

Each category will have its own pinned topics (per category) visible.

One interesting feature to experiment would be to use the [Versatile Banner](https://meta.discourse.org/t/versatile-banner/109133) component. So we could enable the banner only for logged in users with  the option to collapse the banner and have it collapsed by default sounds attractive. wdyt ?

Looks like the only way is for me to be bumped to Trust Level 4.

Many members on my forum have requested the function for the OP to close its topic when the OP deems the discussion complete. Is there a way to do so? If not, any work around or interest for its development?  Thank you!

Alternatively if one of the admins could go through and close all the old [Protocol Calls & happenings](/c/protocol-calls/63) periodically.

I can also remove the wiki for old calls.  Save them from being vandalized.
