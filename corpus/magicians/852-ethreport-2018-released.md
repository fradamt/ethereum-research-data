# ETHReport 2018 Released

Hey good people,

We have just made https://ethreport.info live - it contains the data from over 100 interviews conducted with some of the best known developers working in and around Ethereum currently.

There are tonnes of cool ideas/issues/frustrations/opportunities in there for you to dig into, and it should be pretty easy to do that with the functionality on the site. You can read more about future plans here: https://medium.com/@cryptowanderer/the-ethprize-report-2018-831de9a9280f
