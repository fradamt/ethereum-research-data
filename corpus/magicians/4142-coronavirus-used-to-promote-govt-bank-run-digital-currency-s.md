# Coronavirus used to promote govt/bank run digital currency... solutions?

Let’s say the governments decide to use the coronavirus to convince the populace that a government/bank run digital currency is a good thing. They can promote this as “cash is bad, it spreads germs. so we need to move to a digital cash ASAP” Then point the population to a digital currency they’ve designed… maybe even having banks mining on it to provide the illusion of safety and decentralization.

This post is to discuss possible ways to combat this.
