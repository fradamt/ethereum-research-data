# W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v0.11

NOTE: This specification was published by the Credentials Community Group at the W3c. It is not a W3C Standard nor is it on the W3C Standards Track.

https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/

> Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable, “self-sovereign” digital identity. DIDs are fully under the control of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry, identity provider, or certificate authority.
>
>
> DIDs are URLs that relate a DID subject to means for trustable interactions with that subject. DIDs resolve to DID Documents — simple documents that describe how to use that specific DID.
>
>
> Each DID Document contains at least three things: cryptographic material, authentication suites, and service endpoints.

…

> This design eliminates dependence on centralized registries for identifiers as well as centralized certificate authorities for key management—the standard pattern in hierarchical PKI (public key infrastructure). Because DIDs reside on a distributed ledger, each entity may serve as its own root authority—an architecture referred to as DPKI (decentralized PKI).
