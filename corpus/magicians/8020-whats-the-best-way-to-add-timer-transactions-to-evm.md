# Whats the best way to add timer transactions to EVM?

At our project we are looking to add timer transactions to EVM, so one could, say, do something 10 years in the future. Essentially you want to call a smart contract at a given date.

My question is how to do it in a simple way that would not incur too much performance loss.
