Hey, this sounds like an amazing opportunity for freelancers looking to dive deeper into the decentralized space! ![:rocket:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/rocket.png?v=12)

For anyone looking to explore Web3 jobs, roles like these are a fantastic way to get involved. There are also some great resources out there for developers seeking to level up their skills or find more web3-focused projects. If you’re on the lookout for other web3 job opportunities, platforms like Web3 Career are really useful for discovering more openings and trends in the space.

Excited to see what dOrg will build next! ![:globe_with_meridians:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/globe_with_meridians.png?v=12)
