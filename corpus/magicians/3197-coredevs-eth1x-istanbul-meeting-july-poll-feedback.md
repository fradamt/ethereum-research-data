# CoreDevs ETH1x / Istanbul Meeting July Poll & Feedback

should there be some options in August?

**boris** (2019-04-26):

Feel free to propose! I picked the dates because I think you had DEFCON conflicts at some point? August 14th is Testnet deploy, so I didn’t want to conflict too closely to that. Essentially part of this would be to have clients & testnet folks coordinate.

Here’s also what I think the topics would be:

- work on testnet / main net Istanbul deploys – so more let’s get prepped for testing, interop, and so on
- kick off for April 2020 – pick a name, get dates from @shemnon Cheesy Hardfork Schedule, and essentially solidify what the next HF is
- host working group sessions – now that we have a list of WGs https://en.ethereum.wiki/eth1 we can ask those people to organize and just help host them

Also: to state again – I’m floating this as a proposed option. Should CoreDevs meet ~3-4 times per year, with the assumption that DevCon has meetings as well?

What does “Week of” mean?  2 days?  5 days?

About 20 family members converge on my place August 2, and we need time to get ready.

It means some TBD days in that week that will likely be a max of 2 days.
