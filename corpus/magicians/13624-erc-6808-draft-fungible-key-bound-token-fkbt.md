# ERC-6808 Draft: Fungible Key Bound Token (FKBT)

A standard interface for Fungible Key Bound Tokens, also known as a **FKBT**

The Key Bound Token Standard is a new standard focused on self-custodial security. The users of the fungible version can benefit from its integrated decentralized anti-theft mechanism. By binding two additional wallets, this standard prevents attackers and scammers alike to use your asset, even if they gain control of your seed phrase or private key.

[PR-6808](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6808)
