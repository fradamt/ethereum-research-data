# Standard for authorized stores

I am working on a project where some data is saved in a store under some circumstances.

The final user submits the data, but that submission must be authorized by the store admin.

Basically, the user receives a signature of the data to be saved and calls a smart contract method passing the data to be saved and the relative signature.

I searched a standard about that, but I could not find any. If so, I would like to work on a standard for it.

Any suggestions?
