# Creating a new category for "Regional Sessions"

Are there upcoming events which might make good occasions to organize work?

> Not sure if we had one yet in Asia, but I will be there and happy to get that going if necessary @boris are you going by any chance?

Also, please do provide some feedback about the term “Coven”. There are probably better words. I thought a play on “Conclave” might be funny as an alternative: “Convlex”.

Ok setting it to Regional Sessions for now, sometimes I get carried away.

Proposed “About Regional Sessions”:

- All it takes is for someone to take responsibility and start organizing it!
- The Ethereum Magicians name can be used w/o permission
- Please introduce the Magicians to the group and let them know they are Magicians too. This presentation can help, it is HTML hosted on GitHub.
- Please announce it to the Forum.
- Sponsors can be lined up and the event can be supported in any way. It is up to the organizer.
- Some things which may happen:
– Education sessions
– Lightning talks
– EIPs moved forward
– Work to help Rings operate

Anything else we might add?
