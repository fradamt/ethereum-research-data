If anyone is interested in chatting I’d love to. You guys are all top notch in here. On telegram I am @BKBlockchain and I spend most of my time there ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12) Otherwise you can also shoot me an email at Brendan@secret.foundation.
