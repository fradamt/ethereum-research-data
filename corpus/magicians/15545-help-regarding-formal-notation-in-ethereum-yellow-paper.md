# Help regarding formal notation in ethereum yellow paper

I am a self taught programmer. I don’t have background in maths. I have some intuition of formal systems. Can anyone share resources that can help me understand the formal definition of ethereum, given in the yellow paper? Anything related to formal systems/notation or even things specific to ethereum. I am not asking for 1on1 help just need some resources so I can understand it myself. I googled but didn’t found anything useful.

Cheers!

You can explore the [official Ethereum website](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/) and search for resources there. Additionally, you might find free courses on platforms like YouTube that are well-suited for beginners. These courses can help you expand your understanding.

While I can’t really offer any help deciphering the Yellow Paper itself, I can link the [Ethereum Execution Layer Specification](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-specs/). It’s a Python reference implementation of Ethereum, which should be significantly easier to understand for those with a programming background.
