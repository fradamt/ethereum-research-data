Taking off my editing hat for a bit, I have a few comments. These comments don’t necessarily need to be resolved to complete the EIP process.

I think this is a very interesting idea, and is absolutely a problem that needs solving. That said, I don’t think the current proposal is specified sufficiently. It also doesn’t actually *require* that referrers get paid (unless I missed something.) If it isn’t enforceable on-chain, I’d argue that the information doesn’t belong on-chain.
