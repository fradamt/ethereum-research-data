I’m part of an effort working on more clear and comprehensive software engineering guidelines for smart contract engineers. The working title is SecurEth: [SecurEth.org/guidelines/](http://SecurEth.org/guidelines/)

Definitely a work in progress, but we’re collobrating with major auditing firms and developers in the space, leveraging some of our experience in Aerospace with the DO-178 risk assessment guidelines that we have a collective 30+ years experience with.

Honestly might be premature sharing this, but I think it’s important work.

Here’s another one: https://github.com/ewasm/design

Note that at present this only applies to the ewasm work being done by the EF ewasm team, and not to the work being done by Parity, Dfinity, or others–although we’re not far apart.
