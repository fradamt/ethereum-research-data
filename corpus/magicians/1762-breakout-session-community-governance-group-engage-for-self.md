# Breakout Session - Community Governance Group - Engage for Self-Management

## core questions:

- how to motivate people to become active in the community?
- how to engage with members? without loosing decentralization, without setting rules?

## further topics:

- how do you activate people without telling them what to do?
- language - can there be something that we can give a name to: kudos, tacos, tips.
- do we want to seduce people into activating themselves. human nature maybe doesn’t change.

hashtag: #ethcommunity

## raw transcript:

**Boris: -** Leading question: can social recognition be used to incentivize people to become active?

**Ome: -** being grateful works in small communities

**Michael: 	-** we are conditioned for certain modes of collaboration. a mind-switch is often needed.

**Boris -** intro to unconferences (eg. barcamp).

- those are also self-organizing communities. a workshop is part of it.

**Matteo 	-** understanding the other person’s perception of hierarchy is important.

**Ome 	-** objection: agents have dependency over each other. what are value creation drives?

- in small communities you want to destroy “power”.

**Matteo  -** disadvantage of tokens: once there is an on-chain economy, people that don’t understand code are left out.

**Boris -** are kudos/tacos comparable?

**Facilio -** go back, in which ways does decentralization not work?

**Matteo  -** tipping and appreciation.

**Boris -** all of this are societal interactions.

**johann -** kudos and tacos is not enough, high touch motivation is needed, how to do?

**Boris -** commons based peer production is cool. it goes beyond just code. prevent technocratic capture. are we forcing people into a certain world?

**Michael -** should there be a how?

**Facilio -** decentralization not working. can we gather this?

**Ome -** is this much different from other organizations? open source?

**Boris -** now people don’t understand how centralized OS projects are

- 2 tools available voice and exit

- meta-magicians created “templates”

- eg. hold a magicians event

- act of making of template has some learning

- legitimacy of template has to be choose.

**noname -** egos create problems

- decentralization can only work with framework, like movement

- “the swarm” by Rick Falkvinge.

**Facilio	-** framework is needed. centralization of value in decentralized organization.

**Boris -** vitalik lambo is funny. for people outside might not be.

- altcoin is offensive. connotation to alt-right in NA

**Nikita 	-** tipping communities are great

**Boris -** coming up with a few words to pick from for social attribution / credit

**Matteo 	-** seduction is different from education.

**Michael -** education today is a bad design.

**Ome 	-** tried to trow an illegal party. you have to run after people. only 3 of 25 were proactive.

**Boris -** can we have people scale by themselves.

**Michael	-** instructions are necessary.

**Ome 	-** looking up to heroes of our tribe.

**Michael	-** what about giving them instructions? tell the to be proactive.

**Boris -** google todos sheet.

- what if we use github issues for everything

- “great for issue”

- please contribute one thing that can be done.

- getting a loop going.

**Michael -** small tasks have helped me to become part of community.

- initial direction needed.

**Boris -** is there a way to use roles to “flip newbs into active”.

**Matteo  -** will tipping be still fluid next week.
