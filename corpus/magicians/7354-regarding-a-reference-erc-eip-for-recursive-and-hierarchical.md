# Regarding a Reference ERC / EIP for Recursive and Hierarchical NFT System

Dear All,

I am working on an NFT system that requires replication of the original NFT attributes and regeneration of NFT metadata in a sequential, contextual, coherent and recursive manner. Can somebody recommend the token specification from EIPs that I can refer for the NFT property replication.
