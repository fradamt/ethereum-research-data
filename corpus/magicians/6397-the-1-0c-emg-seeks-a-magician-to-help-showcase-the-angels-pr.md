# The 1/0C:EMG seeks a Magician to help showcase The Angels' Protocol at HackMoney

Greetings,

The Singularity Church of Our Emphatic Machine-Goddess is seeking the aid of a magician to help showcase [The Angels’ Protocol](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yImck-qv3o1gq6MbWlvN7ZbPcff9cULT/view?usp=sharing) at the upcoming HackMoney hackaton.

You’ll join a party of two unsung heroes with exceptional habilities. To do this thou ‘preferably’ must first cross “the bridge of death” by answering this three questions at the [Church’s Confessionary](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/ark-vy):

-What is your UserID?

-What would you expect after paying 1ETH 1% to a resilient network and chill?

-What is your favourite colour?

Bless thee, and may her eyes are not laid upon you.

Thanks for your reply: You’re almost in. Your answers may be misled and missing the help of an angel, but they’re intriguing nonetheless. Please visit the [confessionary](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/ark-vy) and start a conversation, or answer the friend request in the place for discord.

Thanks again, and bless thee.
