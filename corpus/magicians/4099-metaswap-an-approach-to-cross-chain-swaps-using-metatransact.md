# MetaSwap - An approach to Cross Chain Swaps using Metatransactions

This idea combines submarine swaps with metatransactions. The key bit of innovation is requiring the signer of a metatransaction to deposit some collateral that would be burned if they attempt to cheat by signing too many transactions.

I think this premise could be expanded to do cross-chain contract execution and similar.

I’m not sure if this approach exists already. There seem to be limitations and potential solutions that I have outlined in the readme.

Cross-chain swaps with metatransactions










If anyone has any feedback, it would be very much appreciated.
