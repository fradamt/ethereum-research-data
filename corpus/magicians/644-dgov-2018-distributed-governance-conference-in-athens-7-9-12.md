# DGOV 2018 - distributed governance conference in Athens (7-9.12.2018.)

Hi all, we are proposing for Fellowship to support the upcoming DGOV 2018 - the first conference on distributed governance. We hope to present it to you at Berlin Council.

DGOV 2018 will provide a meeting point for the distributed consensus technologists, policy-makers, academics and practitioners to learn and share experience in self-organised organisations.

It is a forum for interdisciplinary debate on the most pressing problems the world confronts nowadays and on problem solving capacity that new digital technologies offer.
