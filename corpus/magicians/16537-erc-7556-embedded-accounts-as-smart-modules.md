# ERC-7556: Embedded Accounts as Smart Modules

Building off of [SSO for Account Discovery](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-xxxx-single-sign-on-for-account-discovery/16536), we define a request that allows an application to register an embedded wallet against a users main smart wallet.

https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/100

Note: This EIP requires SSO to be accepted, and ERC-6900 to be finalized. It is expected this may change in the future.
