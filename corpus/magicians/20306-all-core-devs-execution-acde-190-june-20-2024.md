# All Core Devs - Execution (ACDE) #190, June 20 2024

### Agenda

[Execution Layer Meeting 190 · Issue #1066 · ethereum/pm · GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1066)

Moderator: [@timbeiko](/u/timbeiko)

### Summary

Recap by [@timbeiko](/u/timbeiko):

- devnet-1: still a WIP from all teams, but we can optimstically get a version up by next ACDC with a subset of EL/CLs! note that the spec does include EL-triggered withdrawals and leaves 7702 as per the latest merged commit (pectra-devnet-1 specs - HackMD)
- for 7702, @matt opened a draft PR which proposes a different delegation/revocation design: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/8677, teams should review this, and we’ll organize another 7702 breakout before the next ACDE (poll for time in next post!)
- EOF devnets will be built on top of Prague, teams should rebase. Various implementation stages being tracked here (eof/spec/implementation_matrix.md at main · ipsilon/eof · GitHub), and Erigon said it would be nice to have some EOF blocks to test with soon
- PeerDAS devnets will be based on CL spec v1.5.0-alpha.3 , expected to launch in the next few weeks
- I proposed a template for discussions-to threads on EthMag (Template for `discussion-to` threads), if teams have suggestions on it, please share, otherwise, we’ll get it added
- @parithosh is looking for EL admins for the eth-clients repo, see the Eth R&D Discord thread for context
- Next ACDE is happening as scheduled on July 4th, but @ralexstokes will be running it. Have fun !
