# Moderator nomination - Pooja Ranjan

Ethereum Magicians currently has just one moderator ([@abcoathup](/u/abcoathup)) - he does it extremely well but I think the forum could use multiple moderators.

I’d like to nominate [@poojaranjan](/u/poojaranjan) of the [Ethereum Cat Herders](https://www.ethcatherders.com/about) as a moderator - she’s been highly engaged with all things core development and Ethereum Magicians for more than 6 years now. She’s got a broad view on ACD, breakouts, and all the different venues where research and implementation in ethereum is discussed.

I’m looking for any opposition rather than a strong showing of approval to ensure that a quiet forum doesn’t hinder progress on bringing more activity and transparency to the forum. Absent any opposition, I’ll plan on reaching out to admins beginning May 8 to encourage them to add Pooja as a moderator.

**If there’s any opposition to the nomination itself or opposition to this timeline, for any reason, please voice it in the comments**.

### General mod nomination

We need more moderators for Eth Magicians, I voiced this recently: ([# [call for action] EthMagicians Council returns to EthCC - #2 by abcoathup](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/call-for-action-ethmagicians-council-returns-to-ethcc/23827/2)).  We also need community buy in for style of moderation.

We also need more [transparency](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/status-ongoing-changes-to-ethmag-proposal-for-more-changes/23360) on control of the forum & associated social media.

Mod candidates would ideally be [regulars](https://ethereum-magicians.org/badges/3/regular) (Discourse sets this automatically: [Understanding Discourse Trust Levels](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/)).

Mod candidates would ideally self nominate with why they want to be mods and how much time they can provide.  (In my case I begged for permission to be able to hide crypto recovery spam)

### Pooja mod nomination

*I support the nomination & timeline.

Tagging the admins if they wish to share a public view: [@nicocsgy](/u/nicocsgy), [@matt](/u/matt), [@jpitts](/u/jpitts), [@anett](/u/anett) & [@ElasticRoentgen](/u/elasticroentgen)*

[@poojaranjan](/u/poojaranjan) moderates/assists with multiple [Protocol Calls & happenings](/c/protocol-calls/63) and the EIP improvement process, plus interviewing [EIPs](/c/eips/5) & [ERCs](/c/ercs/57) authors.  She leads [Ethereum Cat Herders](https://www.ethcatherders.com/about) and is a member of the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02-membership.html#active-members).

Given the main focus of the forum is protocol calls and EIPs/RIPs/ERCs, she would make a good candidate for a moderator.

Pooja is not yet an Eth Magicians [regular](https://ethereum-magicians.org/badges/3/regular).  If we had more moderators, I would suggest helping Pooja to get to regular status (or manually bumping her) so that she can help improve the forum from that level first before elevating her to a mod.  Given that there is only one mod, then we should skip this step.

Checking the stats for the last quarter shows that Pooja is a regular visitor, though would ideally read more topics.

++ to more mods and ++ to [@poojaranjan](/u/poojaranjan). She’s demonstrated her commitment to the community with ECH and I believe she’d be a great steward of ETH magicians too.

Wait I thought I was a mod? Shortly after becoming a mod, I lost the client that was funding my eth research so I became less of a regular.  In any case, Pooja is more regular, more qualified, and more reliable than me, so I support her moderator privileges even if this thread costs me mine ![:sweat_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12)

**nixo** (2025-05-01):

Looks like you’re a mod of the web category! This is a nomination for a site-wide mod ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12)

**nicocsgy** (2025-05-03):

Yo,

I think you were indeed given category mod with [@ulerdogan](/u/ulerdogan) following this convo [Call for contributions - Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians - #10 by nicocsgy](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/call-for-contributions-fellowship-of-ethereum-magicians/20814/10) and we didn’t revisit this. FWIW I’d nominate you both for full mods. No obligation or anything there hasn’t been much activity outside protocol calls to be honest, so I think you are doing great [@bumblefudge](/u/bumblefudge) ![:sweat_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12).

I would like to use this post share some appreciation for [@abcoathup](/u/abcoathup) & [@poojaranjan](/u/poojaranjan) who are amazing contributors
