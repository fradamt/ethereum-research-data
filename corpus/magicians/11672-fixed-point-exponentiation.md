# Fixed point exponentiation

Is there any work to bring exponential operation to evm through an new opcode ar an precompiled? (not integer modulo exponentiation as it already exists)

Thank you guys

I also would love to see this!  I have included some methods in a smart contract that get around this problem for some processes, but works unpredictably in others… To tailor these methods always and deploy them in every similar contract doesn’t make sense.
