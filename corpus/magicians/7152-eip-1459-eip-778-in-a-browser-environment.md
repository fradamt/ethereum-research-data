# EIP-1459/EIP-778 in a Browser environment

Hi,

I would like to know if anyone has attempted to encode websocket connections details using EIP-778 and if so, what keys they used? Keen to not re-invent the wheel if there are implementations out that there already looked at this issue.

More context at [EIP-1459/EIP-778 in a Browser environment - Research - Vac](https://forum.vac.dev/t/eip-1459-eip-778-in-a-browser-environment/101)

Kind regards,

F
