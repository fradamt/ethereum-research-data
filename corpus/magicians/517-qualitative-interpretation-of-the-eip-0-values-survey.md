# Qualitative interpretation of the EIP-0 Values Survey

Are there any thoughts about methodologies / processes / approaches for interpreting the EIP-0 Shared Values survey?

Can anyone here connect Jarrad to resources or individuals who are involved in social psychology and related fields, specifically qualitative interpretation of survey results?

Context:

[@jarradhope](/u/jarradhope) posted this to the ethereum/governance channel:

> @lrettig @jpitts and everyone else here. I would love to start herding the cats to do the interpretation phase of survey results, how we can can distill it down into a document, quantitative analysis is pretty straight forward, our ipynb can be found here datasets/201805_EIP0_shared_values at master · status-im/datasets · GitHub, but how to best go about qualitative interpretation and the process around it alludes me
