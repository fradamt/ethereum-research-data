# Tackling the hard problems in Ethereum: what to name the CL fork after Deneb

I propose that the CL fork after Deneb be named Errai

Two reasons:

1. Errai is the future north pole star of the Earth, and will remain so for the next couple thousand years when it becomes so.  Perfect for Ethereum.
2. Prague will be the EL fork, and i like the combos of Errai and Prague better than I liked the combos of other E named stars.

Errague or (my preferred) Prarrai both sound decent, imho.
