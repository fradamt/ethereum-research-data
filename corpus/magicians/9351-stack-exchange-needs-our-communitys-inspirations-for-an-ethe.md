# Stack Exchange needs our community's inspirations for an Ethereum-based site theme

To whom it may concern, this was posted on the Ethereum Stack Exchange meta last week:

> Congratulations Ethereum community! We’re going to be creating a custom site design for you that we hope will represent your subject and we want you all to really love it. You’ve been waiting almost 5 years and we really want to do this well. To facilitate this, we’re reaching out now to ask you for what you’d really love to see in the design and logo.

> As I’ve mentioned already, we need some inspiration from you so that we can get started on this design and create something you’ll really be proud of. So far, I was able to find a couple of older discussions about logos and site designs here on Meta. Feel free to reference them if there are ideas you like already - or give us new ones! We’re really looking for design ideas rather than needing you to design anything for us.

If you feel inspired and also believe that the Stack Exchange community is an important cornerstone of the Ethereum developer community, please assist the Stack Exchange staff brainstorming an amazing Ethereum-based site theme.
