# "Wallet UX" or "UX" category / working group?

There was a lot of work done at the “uxunconf” in Toronto organized by [@alexvandesande](/u/alexvandesande)  and others (https://twitter.com/hashtag/uxunconf).

The gathering led to a lot of further discussions and there is a request to create a topic for “wallet ux” on https://ethereum-magicians.org.

**Should we create a topic for this effort in this forum, or should we create a more general topic for UX? What is the interest level for either one?**

Hopefully creating a topic for this will facilitate the creation of a working group, and the development of standards and/or guidelines for UX.

Ha, way more posts tagged from “uxunconf” with the hashtag “walletconf”: https://twitter.com/hashtag/walletconf

Walletconf is more accurate than full UX of the world, but on an ethereum themed forum, ux is probably more reflective of what was explored by today’s group.

How about “dappux”? It’s not general ux, it’s not wallet only neither, it’s UX of dapps.

**danfinlay** (2018-05-07):

I don’t really think of wallets as dapps, personally. I usually think of them as the layer dapps are built on.

If topics can have multiple labels, we could cover all these bases with:

- ux
- dapp
- wallet

These categories are hierarchical and a topic can only belong to one. I will look into installing a plugin to allow us to more creatively tag things so that they are more findable.

I would say UX is an important enough challenge in the community for it to be addressed independently

**danfinlay** (2018-05-08):

If hierarchical, I think `ux` is indeed the tag that is most lacking. `wallet` and `dapp` is a nice differentiation the next layer down.

Hi Jamie, thanks for doing this.  I too agree that `ux` is the most appropriate tag based on the discussions.

Please let me know once the topic has been created and I will send a note to the unconf attendees.

FYI some people were also using https://twitter.com/hashtag/web3uxunconf

Derek, I realize that I have been using the wrong term “topic”, it is actually a “category”. Hopefully later on we can have “tags” but for the time being a topic can only have one category.

I have put “User Experience” under “Working Groups” with this url (and it will appear shortened to UX). It is our first working group ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)

https://ethereum-magicians.org/c/working-groups/User-Experience

Until we get tags going, when we post a new topic we can select UX from the category dropdown.

I meant that both “wallet” and “dapp” would be children of “user experience”.

Ok, that makes sense, so long as there is consensus from those interested in UX that this differentiation should exist. It seems this way from the tweets and comments I’ve seen from this gathering.
