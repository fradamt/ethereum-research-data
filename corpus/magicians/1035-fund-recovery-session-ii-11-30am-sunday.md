# Fund Recovery Session II - 11:30am Sunday

[@GriffGreen](/u/griffgreen)’s Fund Recovery Session I notes are here: [Fund Recovery Session I - 4:00pm Saturday](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/fund-recovery-session-i-4-00pm-saturday/761)

I have very light notes from Session II. There were in particular some interesting points made about using a social contract.

If anyone has notes from this, please post them here!

Fund Recovery Session II

11:30am Sunday

Social contract: we expect this to be a regular thing

Modification of the ERP (Ether Recovery Process):

- to incorporate a social contract
- to incorporate a deadline, phases
- to incorporate community signals

Signaling functions to increase communication

Potentially other governance functions
