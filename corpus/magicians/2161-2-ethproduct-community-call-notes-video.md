I try to announce it in the magicians forum within the product management category: [Product Management Ring - Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/c/working-groups/product-management-ring)

Call recurrence is roughly about every 2 weeks ~ but forum thread with agenda and incoming community call notice goes up as soon as a call is organised.
