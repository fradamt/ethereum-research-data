# About the Product Management Ring category

Recently this past year, there as been a consistent need for better product and project management across the whole ecosystem whether it is in a internal distributed team context or an inter-team open source one.

We agreed we should begin conversations around such matters and provide an forum for meaningful discussion. Hence the creation of ETHProduct.

Topics:

- Distributed product management
- Open source web3 product management
- Attitudes towards PM roles within the community
- Organisational structures

Please see the [thread where this Ring was first proposed](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/forming-a-ring-product-management-ring-ethproduct/2066).

Coming soon: link to the wiki page.
