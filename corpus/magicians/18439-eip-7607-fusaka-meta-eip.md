**TimDaub** (2025-03-18):

What‘s the current thinking around the blob target increase? The fee accrual to Ethereum stakers is now 10x less after blobs and the blob fee market has just kicked in a few months ago.

It was widely criticized that the too high blob fee target meant that Ethereum didn‘t capture any value for a long time as price discovery didn‘t happen. Today ETH is mechanically worth less because of that change. Sentiment is down and analysts dislike the project.

Why should we just pass out a free blobs voucher to Base et al when it would be much more beneficial to leave the target where it is right now so that more competition happens around DA?

> Ethereum is poised for significant growth, with the potential to one day serve a vast global user base seeking a freer, more open economy. Right now, blob usage has been saturated for several months, resulting in higher fees for users and constrained ecosystem growth. Even though Pectra increase will offer some relief, the expected increase in blob count won’t be enough to handle explosive growth as more rollups come online.

This is a crazy claim. Where is the evidence for this? I actually had to go to Basescan myself because this seemed like such a crazy claim that I thought I was the crazy one. I picked a random transaction for an ERC20 transfer and voila: $0.000708

> resulting in higher fees for users and constrained ecosystem growth.

It costs a fraction of a cent to transact on L2s like Base. No user is held back by transacting on Base for $0.000708 or even double or triple that. wat

# Personal scope preference

- Whilst client team & EthPandaOps preferences are all important, the community should also take the opportunity to respond in a structured manner to upgrade scoping.
- I summarized ACD calls async for 3.5 years (former editor of weekinethereumnews.com) and collected summaries/writeups in Protocol Calls & happenings - Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians.  The following is my two cents.

## Roadmap focus

- The Surge - L2 scaling
EIPs should generally only be considered for inclusion if they significantly move the roadmap forward.

## Scheduled for inclusion (SFI)

- EIP-7594 PeerDAS: L2 scaling

## Considered for inclusion (CFI)

- EIP-7892 Blob Parameter Only Hardforks: L2 scaling
- EIP-7839 Unified Network Configuration: reduce config complexity
- EIP-7910 eth_config JSON-RPC Method: reduce config issues

## Denied for inclusion (DFI)

- EIP-7692 EOF:  Geth were against.  (Client teams with greater than one third market share & DevOps should have an informal veto.  Currently this would be Geth & Nethermind)
