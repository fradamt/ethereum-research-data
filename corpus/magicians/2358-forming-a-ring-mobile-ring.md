# Forming a ring: Mobile Ring

Hey everybody. I’m announcing a new ring: the Mobile Ring!

The aim of this ring is to get native mobile dapps, mobile dapp browsers, and wallets working together well on mobile.

Feel free to join! Please add yourself as a participant on the wiki page below if you’re interested:

I’d love to get involved! Native mobile app development was my original entry into software development. Specifically Kotlin on Android, and a few Flutter apps.

FYI we’re doing an organizing call ahead of the Magicians Gathering right before ETHDenver to plan for what to discuss in the Mobile Ring (and select a format for the discussion).

Here’s the forum post:
