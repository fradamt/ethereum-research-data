# EIP-7636: Extension of EIP-778 for "client" ENR Entry (One year later)

It has been one year since I authored EIP-7636, since then it has been implemented in two consensus clients, Lighthouse and Grandine.

Since the previous ethereum magicians post got little attention, I have decided to make this follow-up post to gauge community sentiment on this EIP, as I have seen conflicting opinions both justified with facts.

Add additional ENR entry to specify client information such as name and version number.
