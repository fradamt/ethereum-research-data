# NFT Utility Index

Hi all,

I have a concept to create NFT Utility Index which is a metric designed to measure the usefulness and potential value of an NFT within the context of the digital asset ecosystem.

The NFT Utility Indexing enables a matric design to measure the usefulness, rarity, and potential value of an NFT within the context of the digital asset ecosystem. This will help the users to know their assets rarity, age, and find the best assets according to their need.

**As advised in [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1), I want to get confirmed that this concept is not already in a prior EIP.** Please help me to move forward…

Hello!

How do you plan to differentiate the NFT Utility Index from existing metrics or platforms that measure NFT rarity and value, and what specific criteria will you use to evaluate ‘usefulness’ beyond rarity and age?
