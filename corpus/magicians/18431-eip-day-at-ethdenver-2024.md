[@yoavw](/u/yoavw) will be speaking about Block level warming

EIP/ERC/RIP authors! Sign up on site

We will have sign-up for lightning talks onsite, where attendees can talk about EIPs they are working on or have contributed to and have a discussion. Prepare to present your EIP! We will provide you with a USB-C & HDMI cable to plug your laptop in if you want to show us the code!

The EIP Lightning Talks will follow a 10-minute format of:

- About EIP/ERC
- High-level and critical details
- Discussion

Due to the overwhelming number of registrations, we will do dedicated blocks for themed EIPs/ERCs/RIPs. We will announce more details later this week!

Assuming RIPs are welcome during the EIP Lightening talks, correct? We just proposed RIP-7614 and would like to briefly present.
