# 5Whys twitter brainstorming about CoreDev funding

I have started a [5Whys twitter brainstorming](https://twitter.com/Ethernian/status/1153828572017987584).

**RT:** for the *Why* question one level deeper towards the root cause.

**RE:** for one more answer to specific *Why*.

The idea of using the twitter as a medium was to leverage its RE/RT functionality as the way create a Q/A tree going deep in two dimensions **Why1->Why2->Why3->…** and **WhyX->[A1,A2,A3,…]** instead of single thread here.

Here I would collect results of this branstorming and suggest a place for long discussions.

It is just an experiment and I am curious if it will work.

This thread was extracted from [Funding and ETH1x](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/funding-and-eth1x/3496) started by [@boris](/u/boris) to keep his thread clear.

[# EthCore5Whys](https://twitter.com/hashtag/EthCore5Whys?src=hash) and [# Why1](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Why1?src=hash), [# Why2](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Why2?src=hash)… tags for easier evaluation.

> Nice idea, but following the discussion tree is unintuitive to me. It seems a very convoluted way to re-create the features of decent forum software.

This is not the goal that anyone follows the whole discussion tree.

It is sufficient of to create the tree of questions and answers.

We can collect all Q&A posts from specific level just by searching tags

**#Why1**,  **#Why2** … **#Why5**.
