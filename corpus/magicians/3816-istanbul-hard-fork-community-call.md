Would it be a good idea to post this on the reddit to ask for questions people would like answered?

**anett** (2019-11-29):

Oh, I’m not a fan of Reddit so I don’t have enough karma to post it on Reddit.

Can someone please post it on Reddit and post link to this thread please ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)

I didn’t know who to contact otherwise, but I was looking at this page [Ethereum Istanbul Upgrade Announcement | Ethereum Foundation Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/11/20/ethereum-istanbul-upgrade-announcement/) which announces the coming hard fork, and I thought this question:

> What happens if I am a miner or node operator and I do not participate in the upgrade?

With this answer:

> If you are using an Ethereum client that is not updated to the latest version (listed above), your client will sync to the pre-fork blockchain once the upgrade occurs. You will be stuck on an incompatible chain following the old rules and you will be unable to send ether or operate on the post-upgrade Ethereum network.

Could be expanded to explain how to recover from this situation. I don’t think it’s that hard (someone can correct me). I think they just have to upgrade even if they missed the fork, so perhaps a sentence something like:

> If you do get stuck on the incompatible chain, you can simply upgrade your client and it will catch back up to the correct chain eventually.

A little mini EIP.
