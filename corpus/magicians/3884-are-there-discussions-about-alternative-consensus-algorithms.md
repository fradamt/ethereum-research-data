# Are there discussions about alternative consensus algorithms?

Uh, I find myself kinda wondering the same thing (and maybe agreeing) with this guy: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/78619/when-has-the-ethereum-community-discussed-alternative-consensus-algorithms

Ignoring all the other, uh, barbs?, in that link, I kinda too want to know if there has been discussion about [alternative] consensus algorithms. Where do I find such discussions? Are they burried on this forum? Deep on some Discord, Slack, IRC, Riot, or some community chat channels?

[@ohsix1](/u/ohsix1), thanks for posting! This kind of discussion would be more likely to happen on https://ethresear.ch.
