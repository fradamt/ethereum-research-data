# # [call for action] EthMagicians Council returns to EthCC

Hello Magicians! ![:sparkles:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/sparkles.png?v=15)

It’s been quite a while since you heard from Magicians Ops Team! We are back, this time we are planning to host an EthMagicians session at [EthCC](https://ethcc.io/) in Cannes.

As you might know, EthMagicians hosted one of [our first Councils at EthCC](https://medium.com/ecf-review/grassroots-magic-ethmagicians-council-of-paris-8429ce0f0260) and we brought EthMagicians Council to EthCC multiple times in the past. For this session, we are aiming to host similar EthMagicians Council session as we [hosted at EthCC[3]](https://medium.com/ethereum-magicians/magic-at-ethcc-3-6dc509e94bad).

We want to bring back in person Councils and discuss EIPs, Ethereum protocol improvement and other important topics that are being discussed online on this forum but in person. We believe that occasional in person discussions can be much more beneficial to everyone. We will take notes and post them to the forum afterwards.

## When & Where

**When: July 2nd at 10am-1pm or 2-5pm slot**  (TBD but likely morning session)

**Where: [EthCC venue in Cannes](https://maps.app.goo.gl/h6aUgY5HuyvkoqNe8)**

Get your [EthCC ticket here](https://ethcc.io/tickets).

We advise you to get single-day ticket (available to purchase on 20/05/2025 and onwards) if you are planning to be at EthCC only for EthMagicias Council session.

*We are actively working on getting a ticket discount for the EthMagicians Community as this Council session would be hosted at the EthCC conference itself, and you will need to get an EthCC conference ticket to attend this session.*

## Council Topics - Call for Action

Propose topic & speaker - if it’s you, would you be able to come to EthCC and host discussion?

**For EthCC Council topics, we would like to invite you, our dear community to collaborate with us and propose topics for this Council.**

Do you have an important EIP to discuss? Bring it up, especially if you would like to discuss it in person at the Council session.

Tagging a few folks who could provide suggestions of the content of this session [@nixo](/u/nixo) [@abcoathup](/u/abcoathup) [@nicocsgy](/u/nicocsgy) [@timbeiko](/u/timbeiko)

**Would you attend EthMagicians Council at EthCC this year?**

- Yes
- No
- I need to decide based on the topics of this session

This session will be deeply aligned with EthMagicians vision statement:

**The Goal.** To keep Ethereum The Best It Can Technically Be.

**The Mission.** To Nurture Community Consensus on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum.

**The Work.** Primarily, high-quality Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), accepted by a consensus of the Community.

## Replies

**abcoathup** (2025-04-24):

I’d like to see the following topics:

### Eth Magicians forum

The forum should be the Ethereum home for:

- eip, erc & rip discussions.
- community input on upgrade-scope & upgrade-retro
- information on Protocol Calls & happenings.
- naming (bikeshedding) things.

We need more [transparency](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/status-ongoing-changes-to-ethmag-proposal-for-more-changes/23360) on control of the forum & associated social media. Who has what responsibility and how we can add more people.  [I am a mod, forum was recently moved to EF infrastructure]

We want community buy in on moderation approach (heavy or light)

We need more (or more active) mods, and this needs to be made sustainable.

### EIP creation

It should be quick and easy to get an EIP to draft stage so it can be discussed.  Effort should be on design, testing and championing.

There is room to make this faster, e.g. automagically create the Eth Magicians discussion topic as a wikipost, automated number assignment

I’m keen that EIPs include a slide presentation and a short form video (1-5 minutes).

We also need EIP editors (either with more time, more editors or reduce the effort involved).

### Protocol calls on Eth Magicians

We started experimenting last year using Eth Magicians to link to notes/summaries of protocol calls.

Protocol calls now have a matching Eth Magicians topic (thanks [@nicocsgy](/u/nicocsgy)).  The next steps are including automated AI call summaries and linking to call transcripts & chat logs.

This would increase the visibility, accessibility & transparency of protocol calls.

We also need to automate sharing upcoming and completed calls to social media (X/Reddit/Farcaster).

Unfortunately I won’t be there in person. (at this stage)
