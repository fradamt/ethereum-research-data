# Large Number of Validators for DVT Testing

Hi everyone,

We’ve been looking into the new distributed verification solutions, SSV and Obol, specifically. We have build a decent size cluster of nodes to experiment on, but are having trouble getting enough validators or even holETH. Our goal is to eventually move this setup to the mainnet, but we need to thoroughly test everything first.

We’d like to have at least a few hundred Holesky validators running on our machines.

Is there a way to easily obtain at least a couple thousand holETH to create the necessary validators, or better yet, are there any validators already running that we could take over? Given the current queue times, that’d be even better.

We’re happy to “return” them after a few months. I’m also happy to verify that I’m human and that this is not for a nefarious purpose. ![:wink:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12)

Thanks,

Andy
