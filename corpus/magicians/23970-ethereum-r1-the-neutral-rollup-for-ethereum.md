# Ethereum R1: The Neutral Rollup for Ethereum

> “General purpose L2 should be commodity — simple, replaceable, and free from risky governance or centralized dependencies.”

Ethereum R1 is a new rollup project rooted in the core values of Ethereum: open global participation, decentralization, credible neutrality, and censorship resistance.

We believe it’s time to build a rollup that doesn’t revolve around private token allocations or opaque governance. One that doesn’t require trust in a foundation, a multisig, or a VC round. One that can outlive us all.

### Why now?

Many L2s have become the new L1s — controlled by a small group of insiders, guided by private incentives. We believe the Ethereum community deserves a public, neutral alternative.

Ethereum community has called for us to act. We’re responding with a plan to build and launch Ethereum R1 — and we want you to help shape it.

### What is Ethereum R1?

- Fully donation-funded — no token, no private sales. Just ETH contributions from the public.
- Stage 2 from day one — permissionless proving, long upgrade delay period with a huge set of multisig with broad representation across the Ethereum ecosystem.
- Ethereum public good — Proportion of base fees go to R&D and app dev until 2030 — then they’re burned.
- Replaceable by design — no proprietary governance, no branding lock-in, no cult of personality.

This is a rollup that belongs to Ethereum, not to a foundation, not to insiders, not to us.

### Join the movement

This is an open call to:

- Developers who want to contribute to a truly public rollup
- App builders looking for a censorship-resistant home
- ETH holders who want to fund Ethereum public goods, not extraction schemes.

A draft roadmap is live [Ethereum R1 Roadmap](https://hackmd.io/@kzg/roadmapr1), and discussions are starting in our Telegram channels.

If you believe rollups should be a commodity, not a cartel — join us.
