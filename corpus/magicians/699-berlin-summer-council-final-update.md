We are looking forward to welcoming 60+ people to the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians Berlin Summer Council!

Please review the important information below, hit “reply” to get in touch.

## Timing & Agenda

### Friday

- 6pm - Casual Meetup at Prater Beer Garden https://goo.gl/maps/RzVGnkm6P4K2, hosted by @boris

### Saturday & Sunday

- Please arrive for 10am both days, c-base https://goo.gl/maps/PrHfPc9Pk2t (you can get off Jannowitzbrücke and walk along the southern shore of the Spree)
- We’ll have name tags, but no formal registration
- breakfast & lunch is provided, thanks to Web3 Foundation for sponsoring
- we can continue to stay at c-base past 6pm, just that it is a shared space; there will be a cash bar available, and we can order in food for dinner

[@jpitts](/u/jpitts) & [@boris](/u/boris) are sitting down Thursday to do further work on the [agenda](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/wiki-proposed-agenda-for-the-council-of-berlin-set-for-july-14-15-updated/377) and [proposed topics](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/july-council-proposed-topics-and-working-groups/526).

We will kick off on Saturday with [@jpitts](/u/jpitts), [@gcolvin](/u/gcolvin) et all to set the rules of engagement, principles, and so on.

Expect this to be very collaborative and unconference style. We’ll have a “main” space where we can all gather, and some set aside space and time where people can choose to gather in smaller groups. Plus: outside space for “hallway conversations”.

## Presentations

Do you have slides? Lightning talks or EIPs can be usefully illustrated with 3 - 10 slides, and are great to capture along with (short) talks. Please email [@boris](/u/boris) (reply to this email) your slides so we can run them from one laptop.

## Sponsors & Donations

Thank you sponsors!

- Web3 Foundation: host organization on the ground in Berlin, taking care of breakfast & lunch both days
- Santiment: video streaming team sponsorship, paying for the video crew to come and capture talks & mini interviews
- Community Sponsors are those that have donated 1 ETH or more – thank you Giveth and Livepeer

We ask that attendees consider a suggested 0.1 ETH [donation](https://donations.ethereum-magicians.org/) as we build out the Magi and help support councils and working groups.

Thank you as well to [@ligi](/u/ligi) for being our keyholder at c-base.

## Social

Follow [@EthMagicians](https://twitter.com/ethmagicians), mention that account or tag with *#ethmagicians*

[@mattlock](/u/mattlock) you can add it to the agenda yourself: [Wiki: Proposed agenda for the "Council of Berlin", set for July 14-15 (updated)](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/wiki-proposed-agenda-for-the-council-of-berlin-set-for-july-14-15-updated/377) . Looking forward to hearing it!

Just noticed this is happening. Is it too late to register now (just did it)?

---

**boris** (2018-07-12):

Hi [@void4](/u/void4) — everyone is welcome. This post should have all the info you need to attend.

Hi Ladies and Gents! So sad about my schedule change to Korea for blockchain week and inability to meet for the Summer Council.

I was looking forward to collaborate on optimizing the EIP process, scaling Magicians globally and methods to decentralize the product backlog without all the noise. Hopefully this message gives sufficient time to make any changes if needed. Good news is that my partner and friend [@Jason_C](/u/jason_c)  will be there! ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)

[@boris](/u/boris) thanks for all your contributions

[@jpitts](/u/jpitts) Jason had so many good things to say about you, hope to meet you sometime soon

[@gcolvin](/u/gcolvin) And we miss each other once again - maybe I’ll see you in CO

Have fun and excited for great things to happen!

[@boris](/u/boris) or [@jpitts](/u/jpitts) Do you know when we will have the final link for the LivePeer stream to share?

**boris** (2018-07-17):

I have all the videos and will be uploading them to Viewly in the next couple of days. They will be linked / embedded in the forum.
