# More validators on the node less reward

If you have more  validators on your node and ip address then you get less reward and if you have less validators on your node and ip address you get more reward. If you are the single validator you help protect the network the most. And you should be rewarded the most percentage. The more validators one entity has the less is helping protect the network.
