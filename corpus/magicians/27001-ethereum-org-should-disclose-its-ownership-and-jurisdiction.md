# Ethereum.org should disclose its ownership and jurisdiction

### Type of suggestion

Update existing content

### Current content or behaviour

The [ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org) website ownership structure is opaque.

### Proposed change

I think the ownership information of [ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org) should be published to the website as well as published in the standardized WHOIS domain information.

### Motivation and context

The [ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org) website hosts the [blog.ethereum.org](http://blog.ethereum.org) official blog of the Ethereum Foundation. This is the official place that announces upgrades to the Ethereum software. And the Ethereum software is subject to the Ethereum trademark which is owned by the Ethereum Foundation.

Why is the [ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org) website allowed to propose changes to the Ethereum client software but nobody else is allowed to (see trademark)?

Effectively this means that no independent entity can ever actually fork Ethereum Mainnet or propose a change to the client against the will of that organization.

The special relationship of the [ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org) website should be disclosed by publishing its ownership information, including the individuals/organizations and the legal jurisdiction that it is published from.

*The future will not be run from the shadows.*
