# EIP-1167 - updated & last-call period extended

Based on feedback, EIP-1167 was updated in the following ways:

- Specification includes code-golf runtime gas improvements
- Specification includes vanity-address based proxy deployment gas improvements
- Removed Factory and Probe code from the EIP as they are not part of the standard - they are tooling that implements / utilizes the standard.

The plan is to keep the EIP in “last call” status, but extend the comment period for an additional two weeks to allow for reaction to these changes.
