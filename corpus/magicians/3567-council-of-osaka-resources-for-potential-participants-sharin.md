# [Council of Osaka] Resources for potential participants (sharing accomodations, ...)

My last post was about [the organisation the event](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/council-of-osaka-date-and-place/3367), but having a location is not enough, we also need to make sure people will actually be present in Osaka to have fruitful discussions.

During yesterday’s council, [@boris](/u/boris) proposed that ethereum magicians resources could be used to help potential participants find/share accommodation in Osaka. I’m sure he will be able to tell everyone a bit more about what he really meant (I’m really uncomfortable speaking in someone else’s name).

So if:

- you want to look for roommates with magicians powers (or crypto kitties, which are the best kind of kitty since they don’t have to go through quarantine) → Use this thread
- If you need financial help from the community to attend the council → Use this thread
- If you want to discuss anything about attending the council → Use this thread

For the council organisation, follow the link to my previous thread (at the top of this unnecessarily long message)

**boris** (2019-08-21):

Thanks [@Amxx](/u/amxx) — I had a call with [@jpitts](/u/jpitts) and [@anett](/u/anett) where we brainstormed some ideas. We can check on in this next week or the week after to dig in more on who wants to help.
