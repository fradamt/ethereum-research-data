# Ethereum Improvement Proposal all info

General information regarding EIPs

# How to submit an EIP

**Tutorial**

1. Write your EIP using EIP template
2. Create PR to ethereum/EIPs repo
3. Share link to your EIP alongside with EIP description to Eth Magicians forum to gather community feedback
4. EIP Editors will assign EIP number to your EIP

Notes:

- Points 3 and 4 can be swapped, it may take some time for EIP Editors to assign number to your EIP
- Do not copy paste the EIP itself to FEM forum, post just overview and link to the EIP itself

Discourse allows templates to be setup per category, it would be good to have a template stating don’t copypaste your entire EIP here.

Hey, I have not being able to push a new branch to the repository, is there something I am missing? How can I get access to write?

Thank you all

Edit: I got it working

I forgot to fork the repository, push to my own copy, then make a PR from My repository to the origin repository

Hi,

Where do I copy my EIP and how to name a EIP.

Regards

You can create your EIP/ERC in the GitHub repo and a discussion post on Eth Magicians.

**TateGunning** (2023-09-25):

Smart. I learned from your comment but hadnt considered doing that in bulk yet. I appreciate you explaining how you figured your dilemna out. Do I understand this correctly: fork any desirable into your repository then merge, is this right?

---

**RenanSouza2** (2023-09-25):

When you fork the repository it creates a repository in your account that is a copy of the one in ethereum foundation`s account

This one you will have permission to push commits to

Then you make a pull request (PR) from your fork to the original one

**TateGunning** (2023-09-25):

Genius. Makes sense. The internet is great at knocking people off course, speaking generally, so it’s nice to have your interaction [@RenanSouza2](/u/renansouza2) appreciate it. Going to make breakfast then take a crack at it on my desktop afterwards ![:crossed_fingers:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/crossed_fingers.png?v=12)![:facepunch:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/facepunch.png?v=12)

I saw in the github readme that “Before you write an EIP, ideas MUST be thoroughly discussed on Ethereum Magicians or Ethereum Research. Once consensus is reached, thoroughly read and review EIP-1, which describes the EIP process.”

If I have ideas for EIPs can I just push the PRs and then discussion takes place here?

Best to discuss first if there is a need.

For EIPs you will need to convince core devs of the need and the priority, for ERCs you will need multiple projects to implement (otherwise there isn’t a point in standardizing).

**wkyleg** (2023-12-01):

Ahh thanks.

To be clear I have ERCs (interfaces for ERC-20) I’m working on for a project that Ideally would be standardized as well

thanks.

Is this the current process

**Toni-d-e-v** (2024-07-05):

I need to create an EIP thread, but I don’t have the option!

---

**5eh** (2024-07-10):

I as well haha, my deadline for a Hackathon is tomorrow, I’d like to figure this out ![:sweat_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12)

**Zoltan** (2024-08-25):

I am a new user, just registered about an hour ago. How can i start a new topic? I think we need a new opcode to make things easier.  Would be nice if it could be merged in the upcoming Pectra fork.

Generally have to read for a while before you can create a new topic.  Have a look through recent [EIPs](/c/eips/5) as that appears to be an area of interest.

Pectra is already the largest upgrade ever, it originally targeted end of 2024 and is likely to be at least Q1 2025.  We are about to launch pectra-devnet-3, it is highly unlikely that any new EIP would be considered for inclusion at this stage.

**frank20171214** (2024-09-05):

Why I can’t see the button `create new topic` ? I am going to create a new discussion for my new EIP here.

---

**danilowhk** (2024-09-06):

If I am not sure of the standard yet, can I create a topic here first and later submit the EIP/ERC? Or is it recommended to submit an incomplete EIP/ERC have the link and then start discussion?

New users can’t create topics.

Spend some time reading first.  Especially look at [EIPs](/c/eips/5) & [ERCs](/c/ercs/57)
