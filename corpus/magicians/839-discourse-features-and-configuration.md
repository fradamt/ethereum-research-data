# Discourse features and configuration

I was having a discussion on Twitter with [@Ethernian](/u/ethernian) about how we may very well need some form of “moderation” here at some point. I put that in quotes because it could mean a number of things.

This site runs [Discourse](http://discourse.org). It has lots of features — some through configuration, some through plugins.

I have suggested that we use the [Scrolls rep issues](http://GitHub.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/issues) to file requested changes or updates.

This #site-feedback category can of course be used for general discussion, but issues can help us keep a log of major changes.
