# EIP Aesthetic: Milestone Token

Just a fun proposal: what if milestone achieving EIP like EIP 1559 had NFT art like a book cover similar to [Stripe Press](https://press.stripe.com/). Fundamental pricing research in Ethereum’s space is more broadly applicable. Shareable links with visually appealing metadata and self-contained research that allows for extensions might be good marketing for institutional investor buy-in.
