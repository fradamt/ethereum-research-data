# DAPP UX & adoption unconf in Prague (June 30)

Hi everyone,

as I mentioned at the web3 UX unconf, I’m organizing a followup UX event in Prague this June.

To goal of the event to learn from each other’s approaches, share best practices and find a way to collaborate in order to bring all of those groundbreaking apps to masses.

The event is happening in the Institute of Cryptoanarchy in Prague, on the **June 30**. It’s a free one day invite-only event which will publicly live-streamed.

The event is locked, for now, to first secure spots for people working on relevant projects:

If you wish to present or attend, please let me know here or via [josef@polynom.com](mailto:josef@polynom.com) and I’ll send you the password.

If you will be in Prague before and after the event, I’ll also organize the following sides:

**Friday, June 29**

Intro dinner/drinks

**Saturday, June 30**

The event itself.

After unconf dinner

**Sunday, July 1**

Open panel and working session

If you wish to stay in Prague and you are looking for a workspace, let me know and I can get you a spot in the Institute or Paper Hub co-work in the same building.

Any suggestions are welcomed.
