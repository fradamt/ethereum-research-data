# EIP-6810: Ex Post Facto Cascading Revert

https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6810

The aim of this EIP is to solve all of Ethereum’s user experience issues by finally allowing users to revert their previous transactions.

Currently it is only possible to revert internal transactions within the same transaction.
