This is a “Meta-Ring” intended to encompass the Ethereum 1.x initiative and related working groups (the participants in which may form Rings).

Proposed working groups of Ethereum 1.x:

- State Rent Ethereum State rent for Eth 1.x pre-EIP document
- eWasm Ewasm working group proposal for Eth 1.x
- eWasm (duplicate) Ethereum 1.x - Ewasm Working Group proposal
- Simulation of changes/data to inform motivation (Shahan from Pantheon to lead)
- Reducing storage via archiving logs and blocks (Peter from go-ethereum to lead)
