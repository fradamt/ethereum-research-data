# Is everyone getting their emails? Post issues here

In the gitter channel I got some feedback that email confirmations weren’t going through. It looks fixed, but I want to know if there are other cases of lost emails.

**jpitts** (2018-03-02):

It turns out that the issue was not configuration but that I had not put in my CC at the email service! Emails should be going out more reliably now.

Ping me on the ethereum/governance gitter channel or here if you cannot log in or have not received a confirmation email.
