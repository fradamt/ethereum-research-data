# API Monitoring Tool Research Needs

Hello, I’m the developer of Ethereum, I’m searching the Address monitoring tool and API monitoring tool now. I have researched many platforms, but they all provide single-node RPC data. Is there an API tool like Tokenview（[https://services.tokenview.com/en/invite?utm_source=redit&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=dev11）that](https://services.tokenview.com/en/invite?utm_source=redit&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=dev11%EF%BC%89that) directly provides encapsulated data?

[@RYO](/u/ryo) I assume you mean that you **develop on Ethereum** rather than you are the **developer of Ethereum**.  You may want to tidy up this language.

Ethereum is an open project and so we are all the developer.
