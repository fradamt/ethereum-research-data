# Nonce minter bot for ERC20Mintable open source wallet supply recovery

`eip-nonce_minter_bot.md` using [eip-template.md](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md)

Here is my [prior draft](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereumnoobies/comments/z093rn/unrecoverable_wallets/ixcimxb/)

Abstract

Isn’t a ‘bot’ a program with a GUI? Using a nonce scope, a *unique* ERC20Mintable contract forges wei. Can the load balanced nodes of Ethereum wei facilities suspend mintability to additional RPC contracts? I want to make an open source nonce minter bot for wallet supply key recovery. *The nonce scope is permitted if the host is set, perhaps with consensus to change services.*

Motivation

I’ve been concerned with lost passwords in my traditional app development, so I often apply phone number logins. Identification provision authentication requires a unique caller to mint in an assertively open source environment.

*How can we be sure the Authority service (i.e. droplet) is deploying to the* `--nat=extip`, [GitHub.com/nickcarducci/nonce-minter-bot](http://GitHub.com/nickcarducci/nonce-minter-bot)?

> This enode can then be included in your genesis.json file and will be used by other nodes to sync to the blockchain and other stuff.

I’m not sure this is content addressable unless Digital Ocean open sources this code *all the way upstream*…

> Simply embed this button and associated link in your README.md files in GitHub repos, or web pages, and let us handle the app deployment process.
