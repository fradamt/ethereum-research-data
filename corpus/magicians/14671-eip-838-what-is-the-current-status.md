# EIP-838: What is the current status?

Hey everyone,

I’ve found this EIP here https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/838,

What is the current status of it? I know solidity implements it but it is not listed alongside other EIPs

Would it be good to document it?

EIP-838 does not exist: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-838.

If you would like to open a new EIP as a fork of EIP-838, you are welcome to. An editor might assign you number 838, but I won’t guarantee it.
