# Portmanteau for Heka + Bogotá upgrade after Glamsterdam

## Update:

**Hegotá** chosen as portmanteau at [ACDE #226](https://forkcast.org/calls/acde/226#t=533), after Heka was replaced by Heze (Heka wasn’t in the IAU catalog of stars)

### Portmanteau poll:

A portmanteau ([Portmanteau generator](https://portmanteaur.com)) is needed for Heka + Bogotá upgrade after Glamsterdam

The consensus layer uses [star names](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-pm/issues/215) for upgrades whilst the execution layer uses [Devcon cities](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/more-frequent-smaller-hardforks-vs-less-frequent-larger-ones/2929/33).

See: [Post-Merge Network Upgrade Naming Schemes](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rfc-post-merge-network-upgrade-naming-schemes/11977)

Recent upgrade names:

- Shapella (Shanghai + Capella)
- Dencun (Cancun + Deneb)
- Pectra (Prague + Electra)
- Fusaka (Fulu + Osaka)
- Glamsterdam (Gloas + Amsterdam)
- Heka + Bogotá

*(Apologies if I am stepping on the process for selecting star upgrade names, [I’m not a core dev](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1235979765879844864))*

### Portmanteaus for “Heka + Bogotá”

Criteria (similar to [testnet naming](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/naming-the-public-pectra-testnet/21263)):

- Should be a portmanteau
- Should be easy to search online (ideally unique)
- Should be difficult to pronounce
- Optionally have difficult spelling

| Portmanteau | Blend | Pronunciation | Uniqueness Check | Google Search |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hekotá | Hek(a) + (Bog)otá | Smooth “Heh-KO-tah” flow; the “ko” lands cleanly, then glides into the final “ta” – confident, almost mythic. | Extremely rare. Only scattered personal-name or typo hits; no brands, projects, or tokens. | Search |
| Hektá | Hek(a) + (Bo)tá | “K-t” staccato snap, like biting into unripe fruit—crisp but clumsy. | Sparse, mostly “hectare” variants in metrics; no tech branding. | Search |
| Hegotá | He(ka) + g(ota) from Bogotá | “Hg” initial cluster gurgles like a swallowed “hug,” tripping the throat. | One hit from this discussion; otherwise zero exact unrelated matches. | Search |
| Hogotá | Ho (from Heka) + g(ota) | “Hg” + “go” mash forces a porcine snort—awkward mid-word pivot. | Primarily redirects to “Bogotá”; one discussion hit, no other exacts. | Search |
| Hekogotá | Heko (from Heka) + g(ota) | “Kog” knots the tongue, evoking a cog jammed in mud. | Sole hit from this thread; zero elsewhere. | Search |
| Hekgotá | Hek (from Heka) + g(ota) | “K-g” abrupt flip mimics a glitchy spell—pure phonetic snag. | Discussion-only hit; unrelated “Hekalot” mysticism nearby but distinct. | Search |
| Beka | B(ogotá) + eka (from Heka) | “Bk” cluster chokes the airflow, like a backward sneeze mid-sentence. | Numerous hits (names, artists, companies); lacks uniqueness for branding. | Search |
| Boka | Bo(gotá) + ka (from Heka) | “Bok” clunks heavily into “a,” evoking a door half-slammed—jarring halt. | Abundant results (oral care brand, restaurant group); not unique. | Search |

[@nixo](/u/nixo) unfortunately both of these are not unique, they are also easy to pronounce and spell.

**bbusa** (2025-11-06):

Its a bit unreasonable to add Á as a possible option to a forkname. So All the above mentioned names should be simplified to ending with an A imo.

**leobago** (2025-11-06):

I would like to propose   **Hoggar - Bogota (Hogota)**.

Hoggar is one of the stars classified by IAU Catalog.

**Star information:** ![:star2:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/star2.png?v=15)

- Name: Hoggar
- Designation: HD 28678
- Constellation: Taurus
- Apparent Magnitude: 8.38
- Right Ascension (J200): 67.856059
- Declination (J2000): 4.575295
- Classification Date: 2019-12-17

**abcoathup** (2025-11-07):

[@bbusa](/u/bbusa) in client config it could be a, but I am keen to keep the á in the official name.

Similar to Holešky/holesky

**nixo** (2025-12-03):

Hi [@abcoathup](/u/abcoathup) - can you add Hekotá for consideration? Have seen this one bandied about

> add Hekotá

[@nixo](/u/nixo) I’ve added.  Note: It is a wikipost so anyone can edit.

Note: [@leobago](/u/leobago) wants Heka removed as the H-star name.  See: [H-star name for Consensus Layer upgrade after Glamsterdam - #10 by leobago](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/h-star-name-for-consensus-layer-upgrade-after-glamsterdam/24298/10)

**tvanepps** (2025-12-10):

Hekta is too close to Pectra, pls not this one

> Hekta is too close to Pectra

As Pectra and Heka + Bogotá are separated by Fusaka & Glamsterdam upgrades, I don’t think pronunciation overlap should be an issue.

Core Devs make the decision. I updated the text above the poll to make this explicit. The poll is for signaling purposes only.

**raul** (2025-12-11):

The pronunciation of Hektá is more neutral. Hekotá will end up being pronounced “He-KO-ta” as people forget to write and interpret the accent. And that form sounds quite harsh/pejorative in Spanish due to the declining -ota termination.

> Hekotá will end up being pronounced “He-KO-ta”

We should include a suggested pronunciation in the Meta EIP once a portmanteau is decided.
