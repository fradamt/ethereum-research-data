Vision of Magicians Berlin Council 2019:

**Bring people**  — We want to bring people together and talk about problems that we are facing in Ethereum ecosystem. We are all building and contributing to the ecosystem day-to-day and we all want to keep it running in the best technical way possible.

**Knowledge**  — We want everyone to glean knowledge from this meeting and do good for the ecosystem.

**Facilitate**  — We want to facilitate and let people know what we are working on. On the other hand, we want to spread the word about Individual Ring Meetings. We will try to get everyone to know when and where your meeting will be (but you have to let us know that your meeting is happening).

**Help**  — We want to help you with everything that you need to make your meeting happen — whether you need a space or a whiteboard or anything else. Just let us know, we are here for you.
