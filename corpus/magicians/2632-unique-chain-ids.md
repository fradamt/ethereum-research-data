# Unique chain IDs

I do not think it is necessarily a design problem with EIP155 as the author of this issue states. But I agree that we should try to prevent duplicate chainIDs:

**Ethernian** (2019-02-11):

Similar proposals are arising time to time.

Thank you for bringing it up!

Initially it was [@Arachnid](/u/arachnid) who proposed it.

I will link similar proposals to this topic later.

We need chain id for messaging routing between forks and subnets.
