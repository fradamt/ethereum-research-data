# Directory of rings

Just to keep up to date lets put a list of rings, their purposes and people behind. Please provide ideas, edits and feedback to this. Thanks!

**Wallet Developers** – improve UX, interoperability by [@ligi](/u/ligi)

**SecurEth** – improve smart contract and dapp security by [discourse.secureth.org](http://discourse.secureth.org)

**Signaling Ring** – research and identify relevant signals, develop resources to consolidate signals and news in a trusted community forum, develop EIP(s) to integrate signaling with the technical governance process + Core Devs decision making. We’re chatting on Riot at the moment: #ethsignaling:matrix.org [@GriffGreen](/u/griffgreen) [@phillux](/u/phillux) [@MaxSemenchuk](/u/maxsemenchuk) https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ethsignaling:matrix.org

**Fund Recovery Ring** – research and develop technical frameworks for the recovery of stuck funds in cases where the “‘rightful owner’ of the assets is obvious and mathematically provable, and no user is being deprived of any assets” (EIPs 156, 999, 867/ERPs) [@5chdn](/u/5chdn)

Looking forward to forging these Rings together!

EDIT/Clarification: The signaling conversation that has lead to the site build and this pending Signaling Ring emerged at EIP0 Summit and continued at FEM Berlin, more recently in regard to how a Shasper EIP could go. The technical FEM group noted that even if non-binding signals were to be a part core dev conversations, they should be clarified and EIP’d.

Doesn’t this kind of defeat the purpose that is the difficulty of ethereums governance, if we know suddenly bind all the non-binding signals we have?
