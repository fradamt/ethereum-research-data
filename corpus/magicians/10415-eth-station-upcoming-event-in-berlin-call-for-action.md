I’d gladly join discussions about these topics:

- the EL’s relationship with Flashbots in a world of zealous over-compliance
- the Scourge – how the burning of centralized stake (liquid staking derivative protocols, staking providers, etc.) would look like

I’m open to chat about smart contract modularity!

I’m happy to come and move forward light client EIPs and other general EVM improvement proposals. Two I’ve got stake in myself are:

    [EIP-2330: EXTSLOAD and ABI for lower gas cost and off-chain apps](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-2330-extsload-and-abi-for-lower-gas-cost-and-off-chain-apps/3733/13) [EIPs](/c/eips/5)



> External clients can already arbitrarily read contract storage slots.
> Further, there is a big difference between “giving access to private members of another object is considered bad design” and “accessing private members of another object is considered bad design”.
> In other words, giving software developers more tools/functionality is not bad, just because some might shoot themselves in the foot. However, shooting yourself in the foot is almost always a bad idea.

If one of you guys is there we could actually do make some progress in person there.

I’m happy to talk about the scaling of node infrastructure to meet high speed chain requirements and the coming millions of new users (hopefully)
