# About the Smart Contract Systems Security category

Initially proposed by [@maurelian](/u/maurelian), the Security working group is planning a [Gathering of the Security Community](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/wiki-of-gathering-of-security-community/433) in early September, 2018.

## Goals

To share knowledge to prevent and mitigate security risks facing smart contract systems. I’m particularly interested in anything that improves the working relationship between auditors and developers, and the outcomes of working with a security audit firm.

## Topics

For best results, the scope should be well defined, and strictly enforced.

**
in Scope**

- Secure development lifecycle

especially how auditors can work with developers earlier (not doing security at the end)
- Auditing standards, techniques and best practices

Security analysis tools
Formal verification in practice
Risk mitigation
Upgradeability
Running a good bug bounty

**
Out of scope**

- Protocol governance
- Security of protocol client software
- Crypto-economics and game theory
- Product/service sales pitches which are not educational, or fre
