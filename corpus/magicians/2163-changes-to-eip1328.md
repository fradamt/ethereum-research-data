# Changes to EIP1328

We plan some changes to EIP1328 - would love some feedback/ideas from the magicians as it would be great to stop with breaking changes at WalletConnect.

Would also love to invite the magicians to just try it out - the changes now do not really change the UX - they are mainly changes to the protocol to improve privacy. Would really be great if you could speak up if you have ideas for other breaking changes that we can bundle them up and the next version can be stable for a significant period of time so we can gain some adoption.
