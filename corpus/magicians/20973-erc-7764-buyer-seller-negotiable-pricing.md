# ERC-7764: Buyer-Seller Negotiable Pricing

PR:

https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/618

This proposal introduces a new smart contract mechanism that allows buyers and sellers to freely negotiate and determine transaction prices on the Ethereum network. A new trading mode is added, where goods can be negotiated rather than only priced. This mechanism allows the seller to set an initial price, and the buyer can propose a new price through negotiation with the seller. Ultimately, both parties can reach an agreement and complete the transaction.
