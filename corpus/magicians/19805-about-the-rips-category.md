# About the RIPs category

This category is for Rollup Improvement Proposals.

The goal of the RIP project is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for Rollups in Ethereum ecosystem. This repository tracks past and ongoing improvements to Ethereum’s Rollup ecosystem in the form of Rollup Improvement Proposals (RIPs).

**All RIPs are optional.** RIPs are and will always remain optional standards for Rollups and participants in the larger EVM ecosystem. RIPs and RollCall are not a governance process.

More information can be found at [GitHub - ethereum/RIPs: The Ethereum Rollup Improvement Proposal repository](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs)
