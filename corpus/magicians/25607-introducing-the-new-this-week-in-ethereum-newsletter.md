# Introducing the New "This Week in Ethereum" Newsletter

# Prototype Revival: The New Week in Ethereum News

At [@ERCRef](https://x.com/ERCRef), we’re experimenting with a **prototype revival of Week in Ethereum News**:

## Background

The original *Week in Ethereum News* was founded by [@evan_van_ness](https://x.com/evan_van_ness) and long edited by [@abcoathup](https://x.com/abcoathup).

It has been a cornerstone for the Ethereum builder community for years — surfacing weekly progress for developers, researchers, and the wider ecosystem. It was a pity that it discontinued at the end of 2024

---

## What’s New

Our prototype aims to:

- Carry forward the original spirit
- Combine AI + human editorial review
- Make Ethereum’s weekly progress easier to follow
- Gradually decentralize governance

This is still a **work-in-progress**, and we welcome feedback.

Hey [@xinbenlv](/u/xinbenlv), thanks for this new project. As cofounder of a spanish web3 dev community, WIEN was an awesome way to keep our community updated every single week, and was my fav newsletter in web3 ecosystem for a long time. I’ll follow ERCRef in X and subscribe. Cheers from Spain!

This is great initiative! We all loved the old “this week in ethereum”.

How do you plan to fund this effort? By continuous grants? Andrew had to cancel his revival of the newsletter due to not finding funding for it.

Thank you for the kind words, [@ivanmmurcia](/u/ivanmmurcia)

So far we have been supporting it via grant from [Namefi.io](http://Namefi.io) for the use of AI models.

Since its largely AI-curated, the cost of machine is much lower compare to human time at the moment.

If other folks have ideas or source of grants, we would be happy to hear too but we do want to ensure this remain a public good project built by and for an open contributor community.

[Week in Ethereum News](https://weekinethereumnews.com) and [ethdevnews](https://ethdevnews.com) both used manual collection and curation of Ethereum news.  This was a 7 day a week full time job for me (plus all the time Evan put in), hence the cost.

I hope to bring back [ethdevnews](https://ethdevnews.com) if I can get funding.

I still assign EIP/RIP/ERC numbers and curate summaries for ACDC/ACDE (though [Forkcast](https://forkcast.org) is rapidly improving info about protocol calls).

Though this work is unfunded, so isn’t sustainable long term.

I noticed that "New Week in Ethereum News* linked to my recent summary in the latest issue.

> The New Week in Ethereum News

I think this project needs a new name e.g. I went with [ethdevnews](https://ethdevnews.com) and should differentiate itself with different headings/wording.  It feels a bit weird to see phrases that Evan and I came up with.
