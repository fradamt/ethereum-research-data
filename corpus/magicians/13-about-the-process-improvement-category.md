What do you think about using a decentralized release management system for major Ethereum clients ? I have started a proof of concept and i would be happy to have some feedback. I think it could be useful for integrity checks of Ethereum clients releases and also in the future to assess specific features are present in a given version of a specific software (through a vetting process). In general i think we should use our own tech, blockchain features are great for governance use cases.
