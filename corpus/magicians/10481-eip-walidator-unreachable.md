# EIP walidator unreachable

Hello fellow magicians,

I made a PR to the EIPS repo(https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/5516) with the proposal of a new token. Its my first time doing it and I don´t really know why the PR is failling, Ive run the validator locally and it returned that the draft was valid.

[Link to the PR error](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/runs/7958015787?check_suite_focus=true).

Thanks for the time and help! Feedback about the proposal will also be appreciated ;).
