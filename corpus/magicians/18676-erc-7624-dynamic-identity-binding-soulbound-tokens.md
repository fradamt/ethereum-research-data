# ERC-7624: Dynamic Identity Binding Soulbound Tokens

Discussion for [Add ERC: Dynamic Identity Binding Soulbound Tokens](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/260)

The proposal outlines the introduces a mechanism for dynamic identity binding to enhance the security and continuity of users’ identities in the context of Soulbound tokens, and addresses the current limitation where Soulbound tokens are static and irrevocable, making it challenging for users to recover their identity in case of wallet compromise. The proposed solution allows users to re-identify themselves with a new wallet address while preserving the integrity of their Soulbound identity.
