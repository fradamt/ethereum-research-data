# Council at EDCON 2020 in Vienna?

Hi,

Is there interest in having a fellowship meeting in Vienna to coincide with EDCON?

Around April 3-7th.

Cheers,

Paul

If there will be enough output for the community to participate, we are more than happy to organise Council in Vienna ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)

EDCON has been cancelled because of Coronovirus, so this won’t be possible ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)

A number of teams, including Parallele Polis Vienna, ProgressBar in Bratislava, and Department of Decentralization / ETH Berlin are organizing an alternative conference: “NonCon 2020”.

This will provide an interesting opportunity for there to be a Magicians’ gathering and community discussions. While there are risks due to COVID-19, the organizers of NonCon 2020 are taking action to mitigate them.
