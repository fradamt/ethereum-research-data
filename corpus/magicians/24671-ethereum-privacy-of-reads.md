# Ethereum Privacy of Reads

Ethereum state requests reveal the address, interests, timing, and the caller’s network fingerprint, putting users at risk of being profiled. Users are forced to choose between privacy and practicality, we think it’s important to narrow this gap.

I recently collaborated on two writeups to actively tackle this problem:

- Ethereum Privacy: Private Information Retrieval: Explores single server PIR as a solution to this and other privacy applications data access problems.
- Ethereum Privacy of Reads: A more generalized overview of the problem, different paths around it and a recommended initial approach.

If any of these topics is of your interest or you’re already working on them, please reach out. If you have feedback on the documents presented or recommendations on the path to take, feel free to comment.

Also, [PSE discord](https://discord.com/invite/sF5CT5rzrR) is open for this or other discussions.

Thank you!

Hey [@Brechy](/u/brechy) ! I am actively working in that, have a read at this, especially focused on EU market for data management & privacy.

[A pathway for GDPR Data Management & Privacy for Ethereum](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-pathway-for-gdpr-data-management-privacy-for-ethereum/22567)

Keen to hear your thoughts and happy to chat

Ummm … its a PUBLIC ledger … what do you expect? There are other ledgers which are more optimised for confidentiality. Now pseudo-anonymity depends on the individual having rigorous data sanitation OpSec so sacrificing absolute security in return for convenience/practicality is a personal tradeoff.
