# Simulation working group proposal for Eth 1.x

Along with [state rent](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-state-rent-for-eth-1-x-pre-eip-document/2018) and [Ewasm](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ewasm-working-group-proposal-for-eth-1-x/2033), [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pIW6Uac5Qanx_L5Y_G4Ucrx_gjITkBgzQKmlBQbW3Cg/edit) forms the output of the third and final Eth 1.x working group going into [tomorrow’s call](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/65). Kudos to Shahan Khatchadourian & co. for putting this together.

Adding more details for clarity:

> This document is to capture the infrastructure, platform, and requirements for simulation towards an Eth1.x feature list for inclusion in an upcoming hard fork. The simulation platform is intended to resolve questions that the community has about where we are at, where we are headed, and what we need to know and do to get there.
