# Allowance = Unlimited. What can happen?

Hi,

let‘s say I approve via MetaMask that another address can spend an unlimited amount of ETH on my address.

What can happen? Can this address spend all my ETH without me approving it via my MetaMask?

Thanks!

Yes, basically the address can spend your ETH (should be WETH since approve only applies to ERC20) as much as the address wants.
