My name is ligi and I would love to talk about token deprecation and updates. This is a common problem I see as a maintainer of [ethereum-lists/tokens](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/tokens) - would be super nice to have a way to have a token-contract interface to deprecate tokens and link to the newly deployed ones. Something like [this](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/tokens/pull/110/files#diff-cb98d943d3d798f2504e864be2ce727fR33) - but on-chain as part of the token contract.

[@dekz](/u/dekz)  Hey Jacob. I missed it. If you had it, it would be nice if you share the discussion/output here!

Will do, apologies for the delay. We attempted to video record but the Go Pro ran out of battery! I do have audio which I will transcribe and post shortly.
