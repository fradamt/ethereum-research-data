**eawosika** (2024-04-01):

If the [Change The Code, Not The Climate](https://cleanupbitcoin.com/) campaigners had thought about this solution, I bet they’d have succeeded in getting Bitcoin off Proof of Work. It’s not too late, though;  this EIP represents a more palatable compromise for the Bitcoin community (we can’t be too confident, though).

PS: [@wjmelements](/u/wjmelements): this is some serious competition for ERC-55
