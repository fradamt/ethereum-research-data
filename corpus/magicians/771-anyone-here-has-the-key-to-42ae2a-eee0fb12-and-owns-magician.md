# Anyone here has the key to 42ae2a..eee0fb12 and owns magicians.eth?

[@boris](/u/boris) brought up correctly that if we link to the github wiki pages we might have link rot in the future when Microsoft sinks and drags github down with it now …

I would like some archive from the github content anyway. Could be a github app that at every wiki change checks out the git that backs the wiki.

But to prevent link rot when [github.com](http://github.com) vanishes (or decides it does not want any ethereum content anymore) we could even render this content to html (I did something similar [here](https://github.com/ligi/SurvivalManual)) - and then perhaps serve it via swarm or IPFS behind an ens name to prevent this scenario.

So anyone here has the key to 42ae2a8a80fe2e8dea3820cdf927f454eee0fb12 ?

Haha! My scenario was *slightly* less dire. Moving off of any service, including Github, where you don’t have a domain under your control means you can’t redirect.

We already accidentally did this for the Berlin Council website, probably having an events subdomain for future instances.

Regardless: that would be an amazing ENS domain!
