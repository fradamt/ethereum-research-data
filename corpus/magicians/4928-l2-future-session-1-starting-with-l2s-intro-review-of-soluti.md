> What would a rollup-centric ethereum roadmap look like?
> Last week the Optimism team announced the launch of the first stage of their testnet, and the roadmap to mainnet. They are not the only ones; Fuel is moving toward a testnet and Arbitrum has one. In the land of ZK rollups, Loopring, Zksync and the Starkware-tech-based Deversifi are already live and have users on mainnet. With OMG network’s mainnet beta, plasma is moving forward too. Meanwhile, gas prices on eth1 are climbing to new highs, t…

Feel free to add comments / links / ideas regarding L2s.

We are looking forward to see you joining the sessions ![:weight_lifting_man:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/weight_lifting_man.png?v=12)

Great session!

I want to suggest Session 2 to discuss in depth regarding the topic of “liquidity maker” to easily move from L2 to L1, what are the implication, what are the risk, and how to mitigate the risk and probably what is the incentive for these LM to facilitate assets movement.

Following up my suggestion I found that Connext is implementing Vector right now, may be a great topic to discuss https://medium.com/connext/instant-cross-l2-transfers-are-now-on-testnet-2f1295530c22

Agreed, we should definitely spend some time on it this Friday!

There is also the domain specific flavour in the optimistic rollup camp, i.e this provides a rollup with known tooling for smart contract developers. So, instead of developers ‘hosting’ on a general computation rollup chain, they instead use the toolchain to make the contract and its functionality itself a rollup. Most applications are standalone in functionality like governance platforms, games, social protocols; - having the flexibility to integrate the platform as first-class citizen inside a rollup is the key idea.

Anyway, hit me up if you want to talk about too. ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)
