# FEM Prague appetizer on offer at W3S

Hey Magi! I am sure many of you seen the recent Web3 Summit ticket endowment announcement from the Web3 Foundation. Regardless, I wanted to drop it here and invite you all to join us in Berlin the week before FEM Prague!

There aren’t any *formal* FEM events going down, but I know a lot of you will be in town and thought it would be nice to warm up with some governance presentations from Vlad and one or two *calm* debates on the pros and cons of off-chain versus on-chain gov.

I have been given a few partially and fully reduced tickets specifically for Ethereum governance nerds like us! Just note it in the application form and I will get a notification.

Also, if you bought a ticket and would like your price reduced as part of the endowment, you can fill out the second form in the post to get that process started.

See you in a week! PM me with questions!

Peter
