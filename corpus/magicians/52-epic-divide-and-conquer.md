# EPIC - divide and conquer

I would suggest we divide and conquer the EIP process - some details here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/896

Posting this here as people are not aware of it: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/896#issuecomment-369256689

I think it has a lot of advantages and I do not yet see any disadvantages. Judging from the comments and emojis I am not the only one liking this idea. The question is now how to roll out the split

Ok, every time I hear people quote “divide and conquer” it frustrates me, since the quote means to divide the enemy, and thus, to early conquer them, not divide your own forces. But who cares anyways right?

Maybe the enemy we wish to conquer is the high unorganized pile of EIPs pending debate?

[@ligi](/u/ligi) I approve the EPIC suggestion
