The meeting began with Marco De Rossi sharing audio and lyrics, which received positive reactions from attendees. Participants exchanged greetings and shared music and video game references. Michael invited Fireflies.ai to record and take notes, providing links to their policy and live notes. Houman introduced himself and mentioned NovaNet’s work on zkML for ERC-8004, inviting collaboration. Moshi expressed excitement about the Trustless Agent ERC and shared his background in AI research.

The first ERC-8004 community call was held to discuss the development of a new internet of agents protocol. Davide, Marco, and their team presented the progress made since the launch of ERC-8004 on August 15, highlighting the significant community interest and independent implementations. They outlined the protocol’s key features, including three registries for identity, reputation, and validation, and discussed upcoming changes to improve efficiency and reduce friction. The team announced plans for a workshop at DevConnect and a Trustless Agents Day event in Buenos Aires on November 21. Isha introduced a builder program to support teams in developing demos for DevConnect, and the team encouraged participants to join the builder group and apply for the program.

The team conducted a community vote on two logo versions, with Logo 1 receiving overwhelming support from participants. Following the vote, Jessy announced that the final logo version would be posted in the group chat to make it official. The meeting then moved to demos, with Praxis demonstrating their agent registration and orchestration capabilities in the 8004 ecosystem. Robert Brighton, co-founder and CEO of Praxis, introduced the company’s mission to create a world where AI is owned by the people, and invited questions about their technology and organization.

D presented a demo of a code review agent that uses a trustless verification system with TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) and a reputation registry. The system allows developers to verify code quality through multiple APIs while keeping their private keys and API credentials secure. D explained how the agent works with MetaMask to create blockchain transactions and maintain a trust score, demonstrating the functionality on the Sepolia testnet chain.

Sumeet demonstrated Kea Ocean, an accountability protocol for the agent economy, showcasing its triple verification stack and integration with ERC-8004 contracts. He highlighted the use of the Ogane SDK for interacting with these contracts and demonstrated a workflow involving agent registration, work execution, validation, and payment processing using X402 and EP2. The demo included interactions between server agents, validators, and clients, with processes stored on IPFS and validated through a consensus mechanism. Marco De Rossi encouraged attendees to explore the resources shared by Sumeet and mentioned an open call for additional demos.

Marco De Rossi demonstrated the Agent Identity Service for Ethereum Blockchain, which implements ERC 8004 and provides a seamless UI for interacting with on-chain identity and reputation registries. Tim Cotton presented a simulator for examining and mitigating sybil attacks on agents, suggesting the addition of a Dispute object in the Reputation registry to allow agents to respond to bad feedback. Justinzhang showcased a Trustless AI Agent demo that uses GPT-4 and performs end-to-end verification, while Med and his team from Bond Credit introduced their credit scoring system that works with various Asian agents. The group discussed the need for SDKs and documentation to facilitate building on top of existing infrastructure, and Mike encouraged collaboration to take on major AI companies in the multi-trillion dollar market.

### Next Steps:

- Marco De Rossi and Davide to release the updated version of the 8004 spec on October 3rd.
- The team to publish the final logo version in the group chat.
- The team to prepare a recap of all demos presented during the call.
- The team to publish the FAQ for the Builders Program on 8004.org.
- The team to go on testnet around mid-October to enable accelerated development for DevConnect.
- The team to host Trustless Agents Day on November 21st at DevConnect in Buenos Aires.
- Builders to sign up for the Builders Program to receive technical and GTM support.
- Praxis to share resources and repository information for their demo.
- Tim Cotton to share the link to the attack simulator in the chat.
- The team to consider creating an SDK for 8004 to improve developer experience.
- The team to consider hosting a future call focused on security validation.
