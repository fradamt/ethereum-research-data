An EIP per upgrade would be nicer (but more work).

“More work” aside, the main reason I opted against it is to not give the impression of a “new” canonical spec. When we moved everything to the execution specs repo, I backfilled [all previous mainnet upgrades with Hardfork Meta EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/tree/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades), and now think that was a mistake. When drafting this EIP today, it felt weird to see the specs in both places, and I think it would have probably been better to do something similar on the EL specs side. I still might…!
