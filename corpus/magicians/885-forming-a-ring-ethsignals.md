# Forming a Ring: EthSignals

Hey everybody, we’re forming a new ring around signalling.

Purpose: Research and identify relevant signals, develop resources to consolidate signals and news in a trusted community forum, & build tools to support the Core Devs decision-making process.

[@jpitts](/u/jpitts) could you pls create a subgroup for that?

How the Ring differs from the Governance one?

**MaxSemenchuk** (2018-07-27):

Good question [@Ethernian](/u/ethernian) , could you pls share some info on the Governance Circle? I know the gitter channel, though not sure if any coordination exists besides that.

I have started here a [Ring for Ethereum “Project/Program” Governance](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip0-ethereum-project-management-governance/634/16), which I meanwhile see as “Ring of Ethereum Architects” (explanation will follow).

I would see this Ring: EthSignals as more focused on tooling and Rings Architects and Governance should use it to make decisions. Reason is: EthSignals is not the only tool for Governance (there is a voting too) and Governance is not only about Signalling.

Would you agree to separate Ring Governance from Ring EthSignals?

**MaxSemenchuk** (2018-07-27):

What you’ve said seems right to me

**arrose** (2018-07-30):

Agreed - I think it is best to keep them separate.
