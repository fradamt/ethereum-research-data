# I-star name for Consensus Layer upgrade after Heka

An **I-star name** is needed for the Consensus Layer upgrade after Heka.

Assumes a cross layer upgrade combined with the Execution Layer upgrade (Istanbul - [Devconnect 2023](https://devconnect.org/istanbul))

The consensus layer uses [star names](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-pm/issues/215) for upgrades whilst the execution layer uses [Devcon cities](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/more-frequent-smaller-hardforks-vs-less-frequent-larger-ones/2929/33).

See: [Post-Merge Network Upgrade Naming Schemes](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rfc-post-merge-network-upgrade-naming-schemes/11977)

Recent upgrade names:

- Shapella (Shanghai + Capella)
- Dencun (Cancun + Deneb)
- Pectra (Prague + Electra)
- Fusaka (Fulu + Osaka)
- Glamsterdam (Gloas + Amsterdam)
- (Heka + Bogotá)

Assuming a cross layer upgrade, any I-star name will be combined with the execution layer name **Istanbul** in a portmanteau ([Portmanteau generator](https://portmanteaur.com)), so any name choice should also consider this.

*(Apologies if I am stepping on the process for selecting star upgrade names, [I’m not a core dev](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1235979765879844864))*

Imai is the Mursi name for the grass that grows along the banks of the river (Rhynchelytrum repens). It is said that when the imai star disappears, the Omo rises high enough to flatten the imai grass. | African/ Mursi | "Turton and Ruggles (1978) | “Agreeing to Disagree: the measurement of duration in a south-western Ethiopian community” |

Out of these, Illyrian, Intercrus and Izar are visible high up on the northern night sky, the last one even with naked eye. Intan, Itonda can get just above the horizon, also should be observable.
