# Core devs discussion about a vulnerability in Constantinople, delay of the upgrade

This criticial discussion began at this point on the AllCoreDevs gitter channel: https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5c3e0fb51cb70a372ae2c1f7

I’d say a significant amount of devs operate under that assumption

… and later on during a live call on Zoom …

Thanks for sharing! It’s pretty scary how late this came to light but those conversations are *mostly* reassuring.

> I am against postponing, but I think that is mostly because I have always been incredibly salty to anyone that relied on gas stipends for security in the past and this vindicates all of my ranting.

> I kind of agree with you about relying on weird behavior for security

A lot of people, me included, originally learned how to write contracts through a combination of the docs, word of mouth and random internet articles, I often heard that these calls were safe against reentrancies. It’s not easy to split the “weird behaviour” that shouldn’t be relied on from the rest.

> Not introducing new bugs into previously secure contracts should be right at the top of our priority list.

This seems like a no brainer to me. However some people in that chat seem to be of the opinion that it’s fine because it “only” punishes contract developers(and their users) that weren’t following recommended best practices.

If the above is a path people want to walk down, I’m going to demand some better resources. Setting the precedent that a previously 100% secure contract can be ruined because the code was not deemed good enough really rubs me the wrong way.

In most articles about solidity you learn that `send` or `transfer` guards against reentrancy attacks. However, developers should still incorporate check, effects, interaction of course. In an audit when you see that technically the contract is susceptible to a reentrancy attack I think what often happens is that a note is made: “the check, effects, interaction pattern is not incorporated, but this does not matter as these type of calls guard against reentrancy”. The developer now knows that in the future they should watch out for this (when they do an explicit `call` and not a `send` or `transfer`), but there is not an alarm ringing that this should be fixed right now because in a hard fork later on it suddenly can be susceptible to a reentrancy!

Imagine that you are a developer who writes such contract. They are lazy (which is of course not good) and have read the note on this audit but think “nah, this is fine, we won’t change anything”. Now the hard fork happens and suddenly the contract is drained because of the hard fork. This will anger a lot of developers and will greatly reduce trust into the Ethereum network.

The main points we need to take away from this is that we need to get much better documentation (also at a low level so we can at least be assured that things who work in a certain way right now also work like this in the future) and that we need to decide what changes of smart contract execution is allowed and what not. Any change in the EVM can change to unsuspected edge cases, such as contracts depending on that `extcodesize` uses the amount of gas it had before the fork where it was raised to 700 - these types of contracts can suddenly break due to the fork.

Update: there is now a post on this Forum about [Remediations for EIP-1283 reentrancy bug](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/remediations-for-eip-1283-reentrancy-bug/2434)

I mean, I’m `+1000` on this comment ![:point_up:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/point_up.png?v=12)

`<rant>`FWIW, I fully sympathize. Such sharp corners / “weird behaviour” should not leak out to app developers. You shouldn’t have to worry about this stuff *at all*, and it’s entirely possible to design a system that prevents such things from occurring. The tradeoffs of the current system is not safe-by-default, and provides few guard rails. I think that it’s salvageable, and that as a community we could do much more.`</rant>`
