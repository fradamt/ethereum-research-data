# "Deeper dive on cross-L2 reading for wallets and other use cases" - article by Vitalik Buterin

> In this post on the Three Transitions, I outlined some key reasons why it’s valuable to start thinking explicitly about L1 + cross-L2 support, wallet security, and privacy as necessary basic features of the ecosystem stack, rather than building each of these things as addons that can be designed separately by individual wallets.

> This post will focus more directly on the technical aspects of one specific sub-problem: how to make it easier to read L1 from L2, L2 from L1, or an L2 from another L2. Solving this problem is crucial for implementing an asset / keystore separation architecture, but it also has valuable use cases in other areas, most notably optimizing reliable cross-L2 calls, including use cases like moving assets between L1 and L2s.
