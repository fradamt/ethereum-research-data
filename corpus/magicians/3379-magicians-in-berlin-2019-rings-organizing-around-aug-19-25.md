# Magicians in Berlin 2019, Rings organizing around Aug 19-25?

I’d like to start helping organize ways for Rings to gather during this week of many events in Berlin. Perhaps we could create a general program and take advantage of any time and space available throughout the week.

I believe that MetaCartel Demo Day in particular would like to have some UX-related sessions.

> Aug 19
> MetaCartel Demo Day
> https://www.metacartel.org/demoday-2019

> Aug 19-21
> Web3 Summit
> https://twitter.com/web3summit
>
>
> Note: the Web3 Summit is 40 min away from the Demo Day venue by shuttle, which means that on Aug 19 Magicians should take care to plan sessions accordingly.

> Aug 21-23
> DappCon
> https://twitter.com/dappcon_berlin

> Aug 23-25
> ETHBerlin
> https://twitter.com/ETHBerlin

If you know the situation on the ground at any of these events, and if it will conducive to having some space for work sessions, please list them below!

Update: Please fill out this [Call for Rings](https://forms.gle/MFaY41dFAe2kNsGT7) form to let the organizers know what topics / EIPs you’d like to discuss, and if you’d like to organize a Ring. We will work on an agenda so people can know where Rings and Councils are gathering throughout the week.

I’ll be there for the week, not sure about timing for the council or any rings to organise during the listed events. It will be pretty busy overall but if we can lock some time and space and commit to it that might work.

I know that dgov is running a node on Web3Summit (that’s where I’ll be mostly), maybe another node for magicians?

Dappcon might be more appropriate for the gathering IMO and [@mariapaulafn](/u/mariapaulafn) might have more info regarding the space.

Looking at the dates we won’t have a free day in the week so the rings will need to fit somewhere “in between”.

If I can help anyway with organisation please let me know.

Hi everyone👋 We have finally put up [The Call for rings form](https://forms.gle/MFaY41dFAe2kNsGT7).

Operations of Magicians are collecting the topics and would love to put up a list of proposed Topics / EIPs soon.

We will be more than happy if you would add the one that you would love to discuss about. But on a plan is to have a short session for “spontaneous proposals” too. ![:sparkles:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/sparkles.png?v=9)

We also want to be able to help any Ring meet on the sidelines of any event in Berlin during the “conference week” ie Aug 19 - Aug 25. ![:woman_mage:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/woman_mage.png?v=9)

In the meantime we are working on getting a space for this year’s Council of Berlin. Possible dates for a Berlin Council 2019 are Aug 20 and Aug 21.

I will announce Topics of discussion/ EIPs and exact date and venue soon ![:rainbow:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/rainbow.png?v=9)
