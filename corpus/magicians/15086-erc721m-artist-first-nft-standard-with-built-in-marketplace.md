# ERC721M: Artist-First NFT Standard with Built-in Marketplace and Royalties Enforcement

I’m working on a royalty enforcement standard for NFTs.

Check it out: [GitHub - Mirage-Gallery/ERC721M: Artist-First NFT Standard with Built-in Marketplace and Royalties Enforcement](https://github.com/Mirage-Gallery/ERC721M)

If anyone is interested in looking it over or helping out, feel free to DM me on twitter: [@augustfr](/u/augustfr)
