# EIP/ERC repo split

This topic is posted only because the EIP validity checker requires it. for a new EIP - [Add EIP: ERC/EIP Repository split by shemnon · Pull Request #7329 · ethereum/EIPs · GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/7329)

However real discussion occurs in other places"

- The #eip-editing channel on the Ethrereum discord
- EIP PR #7206 - which contains the moves
- EIP PR #7230 - Which is a PR to EIP-1, and notably has no other place to discuss
- The EIPIP process calls at 1400GMT every other Wednesday

Please discuss these issues there and read up on context in those threads

Actually, use this thread:  [Proposal: Forking ERCs from EIPs Repository](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposal-forking-ercs-from-eips-repository/12804)
