# Code of Conduct for In-Person Events

One of the things we don’t have yet for the Council of Prague or other in-person meetings is a code of conduct.

[@mariapaulafn](/u/mariapaulafn) did you have something for EthBerlin?

[@chisel](/u/chisel) did you have one for DogeCon Vancouver?

I’d like to have one before we meet in Prague. That likely means adopting an existing template.

[@pmauric](/u/pmauric) also brought up some thoughts privately on what, if anything, is needed for the forums here, but I’ll punt on that one, although the two are obviously related.

I posted this to Status to see if they are thinking about this.

They ended up doing the work of creating a CoC for the Hackathon. Thanks [@exiledsurfer](/u/exiledsurfer)!

```md
# CryptoLife Pirate's Code
We want to come together to exchange ideas, make new friends, and build things as an inclusive community set adrift on the high digital seas, navigating these distributed networks by no more than the stars in our own eyes.

Hackers and pirates care about code; not criteria such as degrees, age, race, nationality, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity or expression, disability, physical appearance, religion (or lack thereof), or position.

## Be Open
Be welcoming to all. Especially welcome newcomers to the community. Great things can happen when we show up with an open mind and curiosity.

This also refers to the fact that all code submitted to this repo for consideration at the hackathon **must** be [open source](https://opensource.org/faq). We use the Mozilla Public License most often at Status, but you can find a good list of options [here](https://opensource.org/licenses)

## Be Kind
Be kind to others. Treat their work, time, and perspectives as worthy of your attention. Treat others as you would like to be treated yourself and respect the #buidl.

## Express Yourself Freely
Dare to create something nobody has before. Code counts more than words, so come and be your most radical self at all levels of the stack.

## Build Stuff That Matters
We're here to bring crypto closer to life, so pay attention to the world around you, rather than the passing promise of riches or fine booty. Make public data available, protect private data. Build what matters to you. You can create new applications, find/fix bugs & vulnerabilities, work on bounties, or help others during their hacking. You can create art and beauty on a computer: a whole cosmos awaits.

## Hacking Starts at #CryptoLife
```

Have a look! Also need a point person for this — maybe part of [@tomislavmamic](/u/tomislavmamic) [@chisel](/u/chisel) responsibilities day of? Although I brought it up so can be a point person too.

Great, thanks for sharing Virgil.

Here’s another CoC that seemed reasonable.

Yes, that’s what Status ended up with by updating the ETHBerlin one.
