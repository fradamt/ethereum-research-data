# Sober arguments

Was just rewatching some talks from 35c3 and stumbled upon [sober arguments](https://github.com/cknoll/django-sober). Wonder if we should try this for contentious discussions. Current candidates could be e.g. ProgPow as far as I see.

I have started a Kialo discussion for this. Based on my research, Kialo is the most practical and useful rational debate platform out there at the moment. Interested to see how people engage with it!
