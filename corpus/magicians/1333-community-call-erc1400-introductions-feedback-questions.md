# Community Call: ERC1400 Introductions, Feedback, & Questions

The team that has submitted ERC1400 has agreed to do a community call to introduce the EIP, gather feedback, and talk through suggestions and questions.

- When: Monday, Sept 17th, 7AM PDT world time
- Where: Google Meet https://meet.google.com/zpf-whhr-kfm

Here is the agenda / notes document, please add yourself if you plan to attend, and add your questions there: [ETHMagicians Community Call: ERC1400 - HackMD](https://hackmd.io/RexWNd_4S-K6zz53dlljJQ)

The introduction thread is here:

    [ERC-1400 and ERC-1410 - Security Token and Partially Fungible Token](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-1400-and-erc-1410-security-token-and-partially-fungible-token/1314) [EIPs](/c/eips/5)



> Important update: after feedback, ERC-1400 (Security Token Standard) was split, so that now there is a related proposal ERC-1410 (Partially Fungible Token Standard).

> Motivation
> Accelerate the issuance and management of securities on the Ethereum blockchain by specifying a standard interface through which security tokens can be operated on and interrogated by all relevant parties.
> Security …

Thanks Adam Dossa [@AdamDossa](/u/adamdossa), Pablo Ruiz [@pabloruiz55](/u/pabloruiz55), Fabian Vogelsteller [@frozeman](/u/frozeman), Stephane Gosselin [@thegostep](/u/thegostep) for the work so far!

Please DO mention the questions you want to ask here in this thread as well as putting them into the notes call doc.

Thanks everyone who attended the call, thanks [@AdamDossa](/u/adamdossa) [@pabloruiz55](/u/pabloruiz55) [@thegostep](/u/thegostep) for walking us through ERC1400. Great discussion.

So, lessons learned:

- lots more people will show up day of than have put their name in a HackMD doc
- Google Meet has a 25 person limit (and that’s with my business account!) – Jitsi is a good open source option (which also supports YouTube Livestreaming) or Zoom
- high interesting in security tokens!

The [HackMD doc](https://hackmd.io/RexWNd_4S-K6zz53dlljJQ) can continue to be used for notes / questions.

Next Steps as listed in that doc:

- New York Security Token Exchange is willing to host the discussion http://www.securitytoken.foundation
- Use a different platform for holding the next call. Google meet limited us to only 25 participants. Zoom?
- Schedule regular calls, what should be the cadence?
- Meeting in Prague before Devcon. Added the topic to the call for rings on ETHMagicians: Council of Paris - HackMD
- Setup Telegram / webpage for “alliance”

Anyone looking to join at Council of Prague will need to register here: https://www.picatic.com/ethmagicians-prague-2018 (currently waitlisted, but we’ll be making more tickets available later this week).

Over to you, ERC1400 team – as I said on the call, you’re welcome to use forums here for discussion if you’d like.
