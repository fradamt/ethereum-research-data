# Staking Interest Question

I’m interested to know if the staking community grew at a exponential rate would there be any adjustments to the interest earned? For instance if we had nine million or twenty million ethereum staked would the interest ever be reviewed and increased?

At Ξ9mm staked, the APR would be about 5.2%

But if we want to change it, it’s up to us, validators. I think the fees will make for most of the rewards though. Check this:
