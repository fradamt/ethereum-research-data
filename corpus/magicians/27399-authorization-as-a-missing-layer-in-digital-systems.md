# Authorization as a Missing Layer in Digital Systems

*Mats Heming Julner — January 7, 2026*

I’ve written a short paper identifying authorization as a missing architectural layer beneath execution in digital systems. Finance is used as a proof domain, but the argument is structural rather than domain-specific.

good, glad that you were able to pinpoint how authorization is left to be handled in the application execution layer instead of having own layer.
