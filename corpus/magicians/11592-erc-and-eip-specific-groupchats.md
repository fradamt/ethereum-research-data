# ERC and EIP Specific Groupchats

Groupchats, yeah, I know, something that’s very away from the vision of what Ethereum Magicians purpose is - create noise-free discussion to discuss technical difficulties on Ethereum.

Unfortunately, no matter how much we try - people still end up creating group chats to relevant EIPs and have discussion outside of Ethereum Magicians Forum. Which is not bad as some discussion may want to be more private. Although the nature is try to keep things open. But not everyone has time to open Magicians forum daily and so groupchats are more effective way to collaborate.

I’m sharing here some of the ERC related groupchats which I’m aware of that are topic specific.

PLEASE don’t spam them, these channels don’t have good moderation and are created purposefully for specific topic discussions. Join them if you want to contribute, introduce yourself and be active in the discussion.
