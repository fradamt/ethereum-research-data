# Relevant token EIPs

I’m trying to figure out which EIPs are actually in actual use for fungible tokens, other than ERC20. There are a lot of EIPs for safer token standards. Which of these are worth implementing, either because they are in common use, or because the standard is finalized and there is significant planned use?
