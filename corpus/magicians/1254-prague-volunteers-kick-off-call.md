# Prague Volunteers Kick off call

Thanks to everyone that joined us on the call today! Here are the notes [EthMagicians Prague Volunteer Call Notes - HackMD](https://hackmd.io/ynZd1XlHQQeXfV8mottt6g)

Will transcribe some of these into action items into this post after I get to the office, please use comments and PMs to self organize.

[@jpitts](/u/jpitts) can create a Prague Volunteers Discourse group for us and we can see if that works as a mini mailing list.

I will start a separate thread about the Status EIPs & Interoperability organizing.

Contact me directly through my profile: https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/boris
