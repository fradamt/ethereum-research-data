# Open invitation to participate in a Fellowship

*Greg Colvin and I would like to invite the community to come together and participate in improving the Ethereum improvement process (and so much more).*

*Some notes to the reader:*

- This proposal is to jump-start the process. Help us shape this effort by getting involved on the ethereum/governance Gitter channel and attending our workshop at EthCC.
- This proposal is written up in a Google Doc located at http://goo.gl/DrJRJV.

*And now for the proposal:*

**Towards a Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians**

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

— Arthur C. Clarke

We propose to create a Fellowship within which the Ethereum community can self-organize to maximize technical opportunities, share ideas and work together effectively, online and in person, across national, organizational and other boundaries.

**Fellowship Vision**

**The Goal.** To keep Ethereum *The Best It Can Technically Be.*

**The Mission.** *To Nurture Community Consensus* on the technical direction and specification of Ethereum.

**The Work.** Primarily, high-quality *Ethereum Improvement Proposals* (EIPs), accepted by a consensus of the Community.

**Fellowship Principles**

- Open Process.  Any interested person can participate in the work, know what is being decided, and make his or her voice heard on the issue.
- Individual Participation.  Membership is not formal.  We are a Fellowship of individuals rather than organizations, companies, governments or interest groups.
- Technical Responsibility.  The Fellowship accepts responsibility for all aspects of the Ethereum protocol specification.  The Fellowship may take responsibility for related specifications proposed to it in the future.
- Technical Competence.  The Fellowship seeks consensus on proposals where we have the necessary competence.  The Fellowship is willing to listen to technically competent input from any source.
- “Rough Consensus and Running Code.”  Consensus is not unanimity or majority vote.  Rather, it is based on the combined technical judgement of our participants and our real-world experience in implementing and deploying our specifications.

**Fellowship Practices**

**Online Presence**

- Curated web pages, including information about the Fellowship, a calendar of upcoming events, and links to useful resources.
- Accessible discussion forums, with at least a threaded web interface and email integration.

**In-Person Work**

- Triannual meetings, two coordinated with Devcon and EthCC and one in July.
- Meetups, discussions, presentations, workshops, hackathons, and other relevant activities.  These can organized by participants on an ad-hoc basis or with the sponsorship of the Fellowship.

**Iterative Workflow**

- Participants do research, gain experience, present their work, and make proposals.
- Proposals are discussed and reworked, online and in person, until consensus is reached.

*Call to action: please contribute to the Google Doc located at goo.gl/DrJRJV. Any comments about specifics can be posted here. In order to ensure adequate coverage of this important document, I intend to expand on the rationale behind each section and item.*
