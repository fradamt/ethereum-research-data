# Imagine an ERC token with anti theft protocols,

each token has its own serial number for tracking and event logging,burn event that occurs upon theft,fraud,or contamination. tokens are then reminted and placed in the treasury,upon owner verification tokens are returned to rightful owner/

I’m sorry, but could you clarify how a transaction is defined as “theft,” “fraud,” or "contamination” on-chain?

**Rexjaden** (2025-11-03):

there are many scenereos,a simple one would be the initial owner makes a claim that they have stolen crypto(shield crypto),this begins the process of reviewing tracking logs ,which would contain all transactions made with shield tokens. they are serial numbered so logs will be very specific.we compare transaction logs with plaintiffs wallet transaction logs and our monitoring logs. and again the logs will leave no doubt ,once the decision is reached that the shield tokens were obtained by theft or fraud we will immediatly initiate a burn cycle for those specific shild tokens,then they will be immediatly reminted with seral numbers intact and placed in guardianshield treasury,rightful owner goes through  a verification process and said shield tokens are returned

**devender-startengine** (2025-11-03):

That’s a solid start, but I think we should **emphasize multi-signature governance** as a core safeguard in this process.

Instead of a single administrator triggering the burn/remint, every such action should require **multiple independent approvals** — for example, a **3-of-5 multi-sig system** that includes representatives from GuardianShield operations, compliance, a community delegate, and an external security auditor.

i have nthe platform setup with coordinator and 4 elected admin positions.its already multi sig. thanks for your insight,its highly appreciated
