# Summer gathering in Berlin?

I believe there was discussion at the Paris gathering about a follow-up gathering in Berlin in the summer, maybe in July. Is this confirmed? Have dates been chosen?

Thanks.

The Council of Berlin is actively being discussed, and those involved with the planning will post details about this soon.

Also, if anyone is interested in organizing a working group or has suggestions for the Council in general: please create topic about it and then post a link here!
