# Running erigon eth archive node - hardware requirements

As of official documentation the amount of storage in 2022 was ~2T recommended. How much storage does it take for an eth archive node running with erigon? I have 3.6T of nvme and I am up to increasing it in case I need more. Any suggestions?
