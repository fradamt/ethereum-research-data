# Improving the structure of staked ETH

I have an idea about how it would be if we could use 32 Ethereum staked

What came to my mind is the use of the combination of MAST and ZKP

Let’s have a validator that claims with a transaction

It will return at least 32 values ​​in one block

In fact, he doesn’t cover his fund like this, and he doesn’t reveal it either, he just claims that I have 32 ether, for example.

The problem I think is that the party can very quickly assign his entire stake to another validator and thus hack the PoS maybe.

Probably, those coins that are staked should be marked

which can no longer be sticked. In this way, we will have two types of Ethereum, Ethereum that can be staked, and Ethereum that can be staked after a while.

The validator proof that has proper amount of ETH and then we have another approch of Punishment system for these proofs , somthing like getting approve for these amount and then verifying these proofs.

also i think its more feasible inside application layer ![:thinking:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/thinking.png?v=12)

I would be happy to discuss this together, maybe we can implement an interesting structure in this matter together.
