# Gas costs for general elliptic-curve arithmetic operations in EIP 1962?

I gather [EIP 1962](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1962) has been [tentatively accepted for the Berlin release.](https://eth.wiki/roadmap/istanbul/) (search for “Tentatively Accepted” in that link). Is there any information about what the approximate gas cost for the generalized elliptic curve operations will be? Are the revised gas costs for the alt-BN128 curve a good rough guide?
