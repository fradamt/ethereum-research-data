# Protocol call artifacts

#### Protocol call artifacts

- agenda
- transcripts (AI generated)
- chat logs
- summary of actions/decisions
- video recording
- third party writeups

#### Goals

- Record of actions/decisions (ideally by the moderator) of each call
- Quick access to artifacts by the community
- Long term storage of artifacts

#### Long term storage

Where possible artifacts (other than third party writeups & perhaps recordings) should be permanently stored as files in [GitHub - ethereum/pm: Project Management: Meeting notes and agenda items](https://github.com/ethereum/pm).  Ideally in a directory per call, with each artifact as a markdown file.  The repository should be regularly archived.

GitHub Issues should not be considered as safe permanent storage.

#### Transcripts & chat logs

The transcript & chat log should be automagically generated and stored in [GitHub - ethereum/pm: Project Management: Meeting notes and agenda items](https://github.com/ethereum/pm) within 24 hours of a call.

Assume use a folder per call, with a file for each artifact.

Files should be merged ideally with no or minimal human intervention to ensure availability as quickly as possible.

Community contributors can later suggest modifications to improve transcripts.

ACDE/ACDC use Zoom which should be able to generate transcripts & chat logs.

#### Summary of actions/decisions

Ideally created by the moderator soon after the call.

Storage location currently varies, over the last 5 months have been copying or directly adding to Eth Magicians where available.

These should be copied to ethereum/pm once no more changes are expected.  This could be done at the same time as the agenda is stored permanently.

#### Agenda

The agenda should be copied to ethereum/pm after the call has occurred and the GitHub Issue is closed.  This is to ensure that this artifact isn’t lost if anything happens to GitHub Issues.

#### Videos

Currently stored on YouTube.  We need a long term storage option.

#### Third party writeups

We should continue to link to third party writeups from Eth Magicians.  Ideally we would also link to an archived version as well.

**abcoathup** (2024-12-07):

[@nicocsgy](/u/nicocsgy) & [@poojaranjan](/u/poojaranjan) moving discussion here from [AllCoreDevs, Network Upgrade & EthMagicians Process Improvements](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/allcoredevs-network-upgrade-ethmagicians-process-improvements/20157) to reduce the volume of posts there.

Transcripts: I assumed that Zoom transcript would have better information on the usernames of who was talking.

[@Christine_dkim](/u/christine_dkim) do you have any recommendations on a transcript AI tool to use?
