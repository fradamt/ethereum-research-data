## Experiences

*Any anecdotes, experiences or “ah ha!” moments you had*

In the [Meta Magicians Ring](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/council-of-paris-meta-magicians/2826), Elias proposed the word “steward” as the label for people who take responsibility for a ring. This simple label that captures care & facilitation without ownership felt right to me.

We went further to start discussion about having 2 stewards per Ring, and expecting a level of responsibility.
