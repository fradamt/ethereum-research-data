# Ethereum Roadmap on the Ethereum Wiki

I couldn’t find an [#ethereum-roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/tags/ethereum-roadmap) anywhere, so I put up a new Roadmap page on the Ethereum wiki:

https://en.ethereum.wiki/roadmap

I also noticed, and left comments, that the [EIP 1052](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1226) and [EIP 1014](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1014) are both still in *Draft* state – they should go through Last Call / Accepted if they are going to go into a hard fork.

Lastly, anyone know rough dates for Constantinople other than Q1 2019? [@5chdn](/u/5chdn)?

Added “Istanbul.” (20 characters)

[@5chdn](/u/5chdn) I had heard about a potential June / July 2019 hardfork (aka the first 6 month fork), and then 3 months.

Where did Istanbul timing come from? EDIT: saw [your proposal](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eep-5-ethereum-hardfork-process-request-for-collaboration/2305/4). Will respond there.

I created a page for Istanbul on the wiki:

https://en.ethereum.wiki/roadmap/istanbul

[@5chdn](/u/5chdn) it looks like 1052 and 1014 that are going into Constantinople never went through Last Call / Accepted. Clearly they are going in and are implemented, I’m just trying to see if they should get updated. Should I do a PR to show they are Accepted?
