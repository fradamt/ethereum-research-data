# Solved: Help Me Sync an Ethereum Node :-)

Update: I figured it out. Thanks everyone.

Hello everyone,

I am really interested in running a synced node. I want to contribute to the decentralization of Ethereum. I was hoping to download all blocks but prune the state tries.

What would you recommend is the easiest way to sync a node?

Also, I am a non developer but I am willing spend a lot of time figuring out technical stuff if necessary!

Hi,

welcome - but I think a better place for this questionwould be: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com - or your local meetup.

The best way is to copy the synced ledger from other SSD. Do have a local meetup around you?
