# Review the Pull Request for the EthMagicians Donations Leaderboard

Hey all –

Brendan Asselstine pushed a Pull Request to the EthMagicians donations page

The preview is here: https://zen-shirley-5f0272.netlify.com/

Please leave comments on the Github thread https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/donation-leaderboard/pull/2

We can have extended discussion here on messaging / content and create additional issues. [@caspar](/u/caspar) [@pet3rpan](/u/pet3rpan) [@mariapaulafn](/u/mariapaulafn) [@jpitts](/u/jpitts) in particular to have some eyes on this.

Thanks Brendan!

Also: [@jpitts](/u/jpitts) at some point my write access got revoked (with EthMag organization?), so I can’t approve the PR. I would suggest that if it’s you, me [@ligi](/u/ligi) then 2 of 3 should review PRs. And that goes into larger governance discussion too, of course.

[@boris](/u/boris), I have re-invited you. It seems as if there may have been some kind of reset in which you dropped all of the Fellowship “teams” on GitHub in which you were a member.

Thanks. Maybe GitHub like Twitter thought I was a scammer too!
