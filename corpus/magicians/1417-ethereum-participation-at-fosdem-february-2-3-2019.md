# Ethereum participation at FOSDEM - February 2 & 3 2019

I [submitted a request for a FOSDEM dev room](https://submission.fosdem.org/devroom.php), along with [@bobsummerwill](/u/bobsummerwill) as the second contact.

Here are the details of what I submitted:

Yes, we are currently working on Council of Prague organizing and I’m already thinking about the next one, but the deadline was today so I had to submit something.

If you’re interested in being involved, leave a note here.

Awesome! Add yourself to the HackMD. We can talk about this in Vancouver next week and at Prague.

But first, Prague ![:wink:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9)

Awesome, looking forward to it!

Thanks, Boris!   Much appreciated.

Oh, cool!

Please count me in, I’d like to help with organization (added myself into the HackMD doc).

OK, looks like DevRooms have been selected: https://fosdem.org/2019/news/2018-10-14-accepted-developer-rooms/

There are “Decentralized Internet and Privacy” (on Saturday) and “Blockchain” (on Sunday) — do we know anyone from there? Any plans to get in touch and collaborate?

Hey there, this is my first post here so not too sure how the fellowship is organised.

I’m part of the Status dev team and most (all?) [Nimbus](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus) team will be there. At first it was for the [Nim programming language](https://nim-lang.org/) but we would also be very happy to help or contribute privacy/decentralization/blockchain/eth talks at Fosdem.

Here is the Call for Proposals, open for the next few weeks.  I will be there.  I have booked my flights.

I am also planning on attending, I just submitted a proposal for a lightning talk called the current and future state of Ethereum.
