#### Summary

Update by [@parithosh](/u/parithosh) *(from Eth R&D [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/745077610685661265/1282714396816310354))*

Huge thanks to the testing team for providing reusable execution spec tests on devnets!

Status update posted on interop: ⁠[interop-![:night_with_stars:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/night_with_stars.png?v=15)⁠](https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/892088344438255616)

Devnet launch slated for tomorrow morning, clients passing tests will be added at genesis (clients with non-consensus issues would be included)

Discussion about why local testing yielded passing tests but devnet revealed issues (Mainly due to the RPC/EngineAPI inclusion route used by devnets)

Nethermind spoke about the issues they faced with the latest tests

##### EOF:

3 clients are mostly ready for devnet-4, in a good place for a devnet in ~weeks timeline after devnet-3

Discussions have already been had about changes for devnet-5

##### peerdas-devnets:

Lighthouse-prysm seem to be stable on a local devnet Issues with teku were discussed, some issues only show up after many epochs and debugging is still going on

##### fuzzing:

no update given this week
