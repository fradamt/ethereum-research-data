# Multichain address resolution in ENS

We’ve written up a draft standard for resolving other blockchains’ addresses in ENS in [EIP 2304](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304), here. Feedback on the draft would be appreciated!

Other discussion on it can also be found on the [ENS forum](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/new-standard-proposal-ens-multicoin-support/1148/27).
