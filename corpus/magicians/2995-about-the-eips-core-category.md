[EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md#eip-types) defines core as:

> Core  - improvements requiring a consensus fork (e.g. EIP5, EIP101), as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to “core dev” discussions (for example, EIP90, and the miner/node strategy changes 2, 3, and 4 of EIP86).
