# EIP-5994: Token Balance Update Hooks (Pods) for ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155

Token Pods concept introduces token extensions for the most popular token standards: ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155, which allows holders of assets to connect their balances to Pods, which could track changes of their balances.

This Token Pods concept allows to have permissionless extensions for tokens, which can be used for incentivisations (aka farms) or delegations or any other ideas.

Example implementation can be found here:

- GitHub - 1inch/token-plugins

Examples of Pods:

- GitHub - 1inch/farming
- GitHub - 1inch/delegating
