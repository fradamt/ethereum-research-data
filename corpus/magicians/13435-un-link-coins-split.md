Hi [@jeff](/u/jeff), Welcome to the community. Could you give us some background on your topic? I am guessing your are referring to ring signatures here. Also could you explain why you feel this would be useful or what risks this addresses please? Is this about privacy protection? Thanks for any updates. ![:slightly_smiling_face:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=12)
