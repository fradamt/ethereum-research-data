# The BIG 'introduce yourself' thread

I am posting this thread to say hi to folks.  I encourage others to do this same.

Hi ![:wave:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/wave.png?v=12)

I am Kevin Owocki ([owocki (Kevin Owocki) · GitHub](https://github.com/owocki))… I am a CS degree from UDel and nowadays I work at Consensys on [Gitcoin.co](http://Gitcoin.co).  In a past life I’ve given nerdy talks on mental health ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5LHTxIWQZk ) lucid dreaming ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUPKAWOJakg ) and why Blockchain is the TCP/IP of money ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaIeFQd8h3k )

I #BUIDL with web3py, python3, django, and a good pinch of metamask/truffle

See you all around the discourse threads.  Subscribing to email notifications now.

Hi all, I am Jamie Pitts.

I help out at the Ethereum Foundation with operations. In blockchain development, I am most interested now in metadata / Semantic Web and, generally, standards which have the potential to create ecosystems.

For a long time, I have had an interest in self-organizing social systems, particularly ones in which goals are accomplished or problems addressed.

Hi friends! I’m Lane Rettig. I’m on the ewasm team (working on replacing the EVM with a new webassembly-based engine). I also run a technology-agnostic blockchain community based in New York City called [Crypto NYC](http://www.cryptonyc.org/). I have a background in tech, finance and entrepreneurship, but I’ve been working full-time on blockchain and Ethereum since last year.

I’ve become really fascinated with governance recently since I think it’s critical, it’s a lot less well-formed than blockchain tech, and it gives us a chance to rebuild certain social structures and institutions in a very powerful, compelling way.

Hi all,

I’m Dan Phifer, CTO and co-founder of Musiconomi and co-founder of the Musicoin project before that.  Thanks to jpitts and gcolvin for getting this going.  I’m looking forward to many insightful and enlightening discussions that will take place here.

I think we have a great opportunity to set a very high standard for the level of discourse that becomes the norm for this site.  The meeting in Paris was certainly an auspicious start and made it clear that there are many intelligent people interested in getting involved.

It was great to meet many of you at EthCC and I hope I will be able to attend the next in-person meeting (EdCon maybe?).

Hey folks,

Santiago Palladino here ([smpalladino](https://twitter.com/smpalladino) on Twitter), from [Zeppelin](http://zeppelin.solutions/). I’m particularly interested in the government process for deciding on ERCs, given that OpenZeppelin provides standard implementations for some of them.

Really happy to see such awesome people around here!

Hello!

I’m Andy from Status, where I am the interplanetary cat herder. I build mobile DApps, help manage https://openbounty.status.im and run education for our community. I come from a language and linguistics background, with a bit of applied maths and physics thrown in for good measure, and am most interested in the kinds of communication that can be created through building decentralized systems.

Really happy to be here, and encourage you all to also check out https://artproject.io for a really great community project that ought to interest quite a few people here.

Only love for you all!

**gregc** (2018-03-18):

Hello all.  I finally fought my way through the activation system by using a different email.  I’m still on the road home from EthCC, which was a great conference in a great city.  So glad to meet all of you that I did.  More later when I settle in.

Hey everyone,

I’m Paul ([@paulapivat](/u/paulapivat) on twitter), i’m looking to do research bridging cryptoeconomics, governance and my background in social-organizational psychology.

Will be going to “The Philosophy of Ethereum Governance” session shortly before EDCON, come say hi if you’re there.

Cheers!

**michaelrice** (2018-04-22):

Hi everyone. I’m just getting started on smart contracts. Long time software engineer and also California lawyer. Working on how to blend smart contracts (solidity and ethereum atm) with traditional legal terms to see how they could come together under contract law and be enforceable in a court at this repo (lots to do): https://github.com/mrice/solidity-legal-contracts

Also interested, naturally, in regulation of ethereum, blockchain, icos, etc… hit me on Twitter [@michaelricelaw](https://twitter.com/michaelricelaw).

**jcyr** (2018-04-24):

I’m Jean. My key interest is high performance computing. I rewrote much of the ethminer code bringing it up to best in class performance, at least for Nvidia GPUs. I no longer pursue this… what’s the point of developing miner code at this stage? I am fascinated by the governance issue and how Ethereum will handle it. It mirrors current societal problems in so many ways!

**cslarson** (2018-05-02):

Hi all. I’m Carl. I started and help moderate r/ethtrader where we’re starting to incorporate functionality provided by the [r/recdao](https://www.reddit.com/r/recdao/) project for things like governance and curation. Reddit can be a tough, frustrating environment, but it’s where (many) people are so I think it’s worth working with that.

**jamesray1** (2018-05-11):

I encourage you with this approach! If you want to get into blockchains, much of what you learn at university won’t be relevant. (Indeed, much of what anybody learns at university doesn’t get used.) It’s risky, but persevere and you will make progress more quickly than you would if you finished a degree.

> authors: Matt Lockyer[…]() <mattdlockyer@gmail.com>; Nick Mudge <nick@perfectabstractions.com>; Jordan Schalm <jordan.schalm@gmail.com>
> status: Draft
> type: Standards Track
> category: ERC
> created: 2018-04-15

**Update**

The latest code is in the EIP and reference implementation

**EIP**
[eip-998.md](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-998.md)

**Reference Implementation**
[https://github.com/mattlockyer/composables-998](https://github.com/mattlockyer/composables-998)

**Reading**
Original Medium post:
[Introducing Crypto Composables](https://medium.com/@mattdlockyer/introducing-crypto-composables-ee5701fde217)

[Crypto Composables - Use Cases and Applications](https://medium.com/coinmonks/crypto-composables-building-blocks-and-applications-65902709298c)

**Abstract**

A standard extension for any non-fungible token to own another non-fungible ERC-721 or fungible ERC-20 tokens. Transferring the token composition means transferring the entire hierarchy of items. For example, a cryptokitty may own a scratching post and a feeding dish; the dish may contain some amount of fungible “chow” tokens. If I sell the cryptokitty, I sell all of the belongings of the cryptokitty.

**Specification**
After several discussions with the community we settled on providing these 4 extensions to a standard ERC-721 NFT in order to support composable functionality:

ERC998ERC721 top-down composable tokens that receive, hold and transfer ERC721 tokens
ERC998ERC20 top-down composable tokens that receive, hold and transfer ERC20 tokens
ERC998ERC721 bottom-up composable tokens that attach themselves to other ERC721 tokens.
ERC998ERC20 bottom-up composable tokens that attach themselves to ERC721 tokens.

For more details on the reference implementation, visit the EIP.

**Summary**

I’ve presented a new standard for composable non-fungible tokens, ERC-998, that allows for the ownership of ERC-998, ERC-721 and ERC-20 tokens. This allows standard assets to be composed into complex compositions and traded using a single transfer. The additional functionality that can be added to a non-fungible token based on the presence of specific child tokens is open for exploration. I believe that standard interfaces for non-fungible and fungible assets to be composed and act upon one another is an exciting new area for the Ethereum community to explore and I look forward to seeing the work.

**LATEST: EIP with reference implementation code**

###



An implementation and documentation repo for developing the ERC-998 standard for Ethereum.










Seeking any help with pushing this along standards track and completing a robust sample implementation to pass off to Zeppelin for maintenance.

Thanks and pleasure to meet everyone!
