IMO the first option of the UnConference sounds better but both options can be good.

---

**fubuloubu** (2018-05-21):

[@jpitts](/u/jpitts) Can we create polls?

---

**ben-kaufman** (2018-05-22):

Yes that’s possible by clicking on options in the toolbar and then build poll.

These options don’t match the OC. Maybe it’s been edited?

I’m in favor of more discussion, fewer talks.

Talks which share experiences and learning, which then encourage follow up conversation are probably best.

---

**fubuloubu** (2018-06-02):

How do we best facilitate that?

I was thinking about having talks planned like you stated, but maybe another idea would be to do a more dynamic mapping process EIP0-style of figuring out all the angles of what an audit should be and what is in scope vs. out of scope of an audit? Just have a really good philosophical discussion about it, at least for part of the time.

Thoughts?

Yeah I think it was edited but I can’t edit the poll…
