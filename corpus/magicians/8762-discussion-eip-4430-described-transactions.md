Hey Richard - love this. I’m working on something similar that I would also hope eventually is implemented as an EIP. But first working on getting a demo up of describing transactions.

After reading through the EIP ([link](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-4430.md)), it looks like it’s more focused on a pre-transaction description, while what I’m working on is generally for post-transaction description for people to be able to understand what happened.

Here’s the [tech spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10h0-ugy7muRGKZl-9bSazTIrj46xWewt1yXQKZkvwxM/edit#) I’ve been working off of. Let’s chat more some time?
