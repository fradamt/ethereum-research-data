# NFT Authentication protocol

GM!

I have been working on setting up a NFT-based auth protocol. I aim to make it a standard, just like OAuth 1.0/2.0 but I am not sure how/where to start with. I have written a draft documenting what the protocol is. I have also written an SDK which adheres to the protocol to achieve NFT-based auth.

Is this the correct place to seek advice? If yes, could folks guide me how to go about it?

SDK link: [authnft - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/authnft)
