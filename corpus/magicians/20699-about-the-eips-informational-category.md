# About the EIPs informational category

An **Informational EIP** describes an Ethereum design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Ethereum community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational EIPs do not necessarily represent Ethereum community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational EIPs or follow their advice.

Learn more on EIPs with the [EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md)
