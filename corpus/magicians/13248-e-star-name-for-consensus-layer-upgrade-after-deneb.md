# E-star name for Consensus Layer upgrade after Deneb

***Update July 14, 2023***: *Next CL upgrade named **Electra** on [ACDC call 113](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/823#issuecomment-1635053770)*

An E-star name is likely needed for the Consensus Layer upgrade after Deneb,

(e.g. Electra) upgrade could [possibly be for the Verge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5SmmkriuwA&t=2970s) + other features.

The consensus layer uses [star names](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-pm/issues/215) for upgrades whilst the execution layer uses [Devcon cities](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/more-frequent-smaller-hardforks-vs-less-frequent-larger-ones/2929/33).

See: [Post-Merge Network Upgrade Naming Schemes](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rfc-post-merge-network-upgrade-naming-schemes/11977)

Upcoming upgrade names:

- Shapella (Shanghai + Capella)
- Dencun (Cancun + Deneb)

Making the next upgrade after that likely to be Prague + E star name.

[@protolambda](/u/protolambda) has already [suggested](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rfc-post-merge-network-upgrade-naming-schemes/11977/9) **Practra (Prague + Electra)**

> Electra would then be a great follow-up star name: Electra is a star in the Taurus constellation (bull after bear  )

*(Apologies if I am stepping on the process for selecting star upgrade names as [I’m not a core dev](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1235979765879844864))*

Pari suggested that the name for Eletra + Prague should be “Petra”, which sounds much nicer and pronounceable than Practra.

**abcoathup** (2023-03-10):

**Enif + Prague** could be **Pranif**

Although Electra sounds good in pronunciation, I voted for Enif because [Electra complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electra_complex) was on page 1 when I googled Electra. ![:sweat_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12) It’s not the meme I’d want to play…

On the other hand, [Enif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_Pegasi): the brightest star in the northern constellation of [Pegasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_(constellation)). ![:racehorse:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/racehorse.png?v=12)꒰ঌ ໒꒱

[@timbeiko](/u/timbeiko)’s poll showed (some) community support for merged names (CL star + EL city)

[@EvanVanNessEth](/u/evanvannesseth) suggests Errai

> I propose that the CL fork after Deneb be named Errai
> Two reasons:

> Errai is the future north pole star of the Earth, and will remain so for the next couple thousand years when it becomes so.  Perfect for Ethereum.

>
> Prague will be the EL fork, and i like the combos of Errai and Prague better than I liked the combos of other E named stars.

> Errague or (my preferred) Prarrai both sound decent, imho.
