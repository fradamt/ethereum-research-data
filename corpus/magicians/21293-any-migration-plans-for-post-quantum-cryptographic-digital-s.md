# Any Migration Plans for Post-Quantum Cryptographic digital signature?

- Are there any active discussions on post-qunatum migrations?
- Attack on arbitrary account’s assets with stolen secret keys by quantum computers.
- When the actual threat of Quantum-Computer comes is predictable or not?
- If not, we should urgently think about the many malicious attacks on whole of Ethereum(Blockchain) networks.
- Something like discussions in Bitcoin mailing list groups
- like,

https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/Aee8xKuIC2s
- Proposing a P2QRH BIP towards a quantum resistant soft fork

If you have or know any idea ongoing projects about post-quantum migrations, please write on this thread. ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12)

it’will be helpful for all of us in the quantum-Era.

Suppose that it is announced tomorrow that quantum computers are available, and bad actors already have access to them and are able to use them to steal users’ funds. Preventing such a scenario is the goal of quantum-resistant cryptography (eg....
