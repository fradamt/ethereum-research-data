# Announcing the First BuilderNet Community Call

**Join us on Wednesday, June 25th at 4pm UTC for the first BuilderNet Community Call**

The BuilderNet initiative is gaining momentum, and as we continue to develop and refine this critical infrastructure, community engagement is more important than ever. We’re thrilled to announce the first in a series of future BuilderNet Community Calls we will be holding over the coming months.

For the first session, we will be be covering:

- BuilderNet’s goals and progress update
- Path to permissionless nodes
- Onchain TEE service provisioning and governance

Looking forward, Community Calls will be a forum to share updates about BuilderNet’s technical development and roadmap, collaborate on R&D, and discuss the process of decentralizing BuilderNet.

- Zoom: https://nethermind-io.zoom.us/j/95709670391?pwd=fED7m3iNSxsVwjMOOHOXubbcg5xCXA.1
- Meeting ID: 957 0967 0391
- Passcode: 162821

For those who can’t make it, recordings will be available after the call.

We welcome your questions and topic suggestions - feel free to drop them below the post.
