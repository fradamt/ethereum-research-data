# Proof of Value: Igniting Blockchain 3.0 with DAism

I’m thrilled to share with you a groundbreaking consensus that we’ve been developing since 2019: Proof of Value. It’s at the core of our project, DAism, and it stands out as a crucial innovation in the realm of decentralized governance for dApps and tokenomics.

Feel free to share your thoughts and questions below, or to have a try on the[test version of DAism](https://test.daism.io), or to join our Discord server(you can also find the links on the deck).

BTW, these are EIPs developed by our dev team:
