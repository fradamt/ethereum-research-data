# CAIP-24: A proposal for protocol-agnostic provider

I’m sure we’re all thinking about how dapps will connect to wallets in a multi-network world, so let’s have that conversation.

I’ve written an initial draft on the CAIPs repo as CAIP-24. It’s a very simple starting point, but is very extensible, and I think should be fairly straightforward to adapt to and from other JSON-RPC based approaches.

Thanks [@danfinlay](/u/danfinlay). Reading through this I also found [CAIP-25](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/25) and totally rabbit holed into that which is super cool as well and seems to solve: https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/1820 ?!
