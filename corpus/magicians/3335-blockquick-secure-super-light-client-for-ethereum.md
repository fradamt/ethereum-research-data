# BlockQuick - Secure super light client for Ethereum

We released our research results earlier this week. A new super light client protocol, decentralized and eclipse resistant. Needing just 20kb to sync to Ethereum.

Here is the paper: [BlockQuick: Super-Light Client Protocol for Blockchain Validation on Constrained Devices](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/579)

and the announcement: [Redirecting…](https://diode.io/burning-platform-pki/blockquick-super-light-blockchain-client-for-trustless-time-19144/)

The first use case we’re addressing is to use decentralized PKI (DPKI) from those small IoT devices.
