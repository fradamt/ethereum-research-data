# Minimum Standard for Consensus Layer Star Names

Ethereum’s consensus-layer hard forks have followed a clear and elegant naming tradition: each upgrade is named after a star. Over time, this convention has become part of the project’s shared language, used by developers, researchers, node operators, and the wider community.

So far, all selected star names — **Altair, Bellatrix, Capella, Deneb, Electra, Fulu, and Gloas** — share an important property: they are officially recognized star names listed by the **[International Astronomical Union (IAU)](https://exopla.net/star-names/modern-iau-star-names/)**.

This consistency is not accidental (I have been paying attention since Altair), and it is worth preserving.

### Why the IAU Catalog Matters

Stars do not inherently “have” names. Names are assigned by humans, and without a standard, anyone could invent a name and claim it refers to a star. In theory, one could create a Wikipedia page for a fictional star and present it as legitimate. That approach undermines clarity, shared understanding, and long-term credibility.

The **[International Astronomical Union (IAU)](https://exopla.net/star-names/modern-iau-star-names/)** is the globally recognized authority for astronomical naming. Its **Working Group on Star Names (WGSN)** curates an official catalog of star names that:

- Are reviewed and approved by an international scientific body
- Represent diverse cultures and historical traditions
- Avoid offensive, political, or misleading terminology
- Provide a stable, well-defined reference over time

By relying on this catalog, Ethereum avoids ambiguity and ensures that “star names” used for hard forks actually correspond to real, recognized stars.

### A Proposed Guideline Going Forward

To avoid future ambiguity, the following convention should apply to all consensus-layer star names:

**`Ethereum consensus-layer hard fork star names should always be selected from the official IAU catalog maintained by the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN).`**

This guideline establishes a minimum standard without limiting creativity. The catalog is large, culturally diverse, and continuously curated, offering ample choice while preserving legitimacy.

By aligning Ethereum’s naming conventions with an internationally recognized standard, we ensure clarity, continuity, and shared meaning — qualities that matter just as much in protocol culture as they do in protocol code.
