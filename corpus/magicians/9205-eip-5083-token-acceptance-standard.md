# EIP-5083: Token Acceptance Standard

Hey everyone, I’ve created a base Pull request for a new EIP, that allows NFT creators to specify which currencies can be used to trade their NFT.

I wanted to make this an informational EIP, similar to EIP-2981 (NFT Royalty Standard). I have the base skeleton of the EIP down in the Pull request and wanted to know more from the community if they think this EIP would be useful.

If yes, I’d love to flush this out even more and present it to the community again.
