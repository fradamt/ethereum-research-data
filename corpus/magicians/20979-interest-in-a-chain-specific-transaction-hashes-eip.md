# Interest in a Chain-Specific Transaction Hashes EIP?

[Continuing the discussion from [Chain-specific addresses](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/chain-specific-addresses/6449/26)]

[@vid](/u/vid) mentioned in the post above that a addressing standard for transaction hashes which includes the chain it’s on would be helpful.  I answered above that there is a [draft “CAIP”](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/pull/221/files) (chain-agnostic IP, using the CASA chain-specification URI format) which might be useful to revive for cross-VM use-cases, or just useful to copy-paste into a simpler EVM-only EIP achieving the same ends.  Comment if you’ve been looking for such a thing or would be interested in prototyping/coauthoring an EIP and/or a CAIP on the subject!
