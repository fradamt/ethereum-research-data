# Is there any danger pre-EIP-155 transactions will ever be phased out?

Working on a solution to a problem that involves publishing pre-generated transactions for future use down the road. Post EIP-155 transactions have poor support in solidity (ecrecover has uint8 for v value) and in some external tools like ethereumjs-utils… So **I’d like to use pre-EIP-155 transactions**. (Don’t worry. There’s no replay risk.)

**What are the chances pre-EIP-155 transactions will ever be completely invalidated?**

Am I invisible? Very frustrating.

Please post your thoughts/opinions on this topic. There is no right or wrong answer. If you know how EIP adoption/sunsetting of things usually goes, your insight is very valid and I’d love to hear it.

Don’t be shy! And thank you!
