# Organize date information in EIP process

## Motivation

Some EIPs remain “Last Call” status after review ends. This can confuse users’ understanding of the process.

Furthermore, there is still a lot of fragmented information in the discussion of EIP, and the date information about the progress of each process is scarcely organized.

## Proposure

> Added arrangement of date information according to the status (draft, review, last call, final) of each EIP on the official website

## Expected Result

More readability and UX improvements in the EIP process.

It helps new entrants better understand the EIP ecosystem.

Is there any way I can contribute to the above problem situation?
