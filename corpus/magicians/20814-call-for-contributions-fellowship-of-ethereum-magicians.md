# Call for contributions - Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians

# Call for contribution to the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians

---

In the light of recent feedback, I’d like to continue the discussion started in [AllCoreDevs, Network Upgrade & EthMagicians Process Improvements - #23 by timbeiko](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/allcoredevs-network-upgrade-ethmagicians-process-improvements/20157/23) and focus on the forum itself and how we could improve it. Various community members have expressed their interest in enhancing the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians.

I invite people that want to contribute to the curation / moderation effort to use this topic to propose their ideas and volunteer. As [@bumblefudge](/u/bumblefudge) suggested, we need more moderators to take care of the topics. We can also leverage discourse AI plugin, [as detailed here](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-ai/259214),  to bring changes with little human effort. IMO, we should strive to make the forum more efficient and adapt it so that it can generate fine-grained newsletter/RSS-feed type information. This way, users can subscribe to categories they want to keep up to date with, reducing the effort needed to follow Ethereum’s progress.

**Let’s discuss and experiment**, innovative propositions are super welcome. I’m convinced we can do all those things while remaining true to the values and purpose of the Fellowship. This one just dropped ![:wave:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/wave.png?v=15) :

> Related EIPs, gold-standard implementations, existing projects, common implementation pitfalls: all of this information, while beyond the scope of EIPs, is still extremely important for understanding them. …

So far we’ve already recategorized and improved the forum as discussed in [AllCoreDevs, Network Upgrade & EthMagicians Process Improvements - #24 by nicocsgy](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/allcoredevs-network-upgrade-ethmagicians-process-improvements/20157/24)

This call for contribution could be a good opportunity for assets to be designed for the forum. I think we have a great theme ![:magic_wand:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/magic_wand.png?v=15) and it’s under used. While keeping in mind that the fellowship is a technical forum so design shouldn’t go too extravagant. We could have a small poll over logos and category icons. I propose a 1 month period for everyone to submit assets then we can have a poll starting from 2024-09-14T22:00:00Z. Here is my proposal for the logo you may recognize some [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/) vibe:

Thanks [@nicocsgy](/u/nicocsgy)! I like your logo a lot. Curious to see what other proposals might be.

**abcoathup** (2024-08-16):

#### Protocol calls

Decisions/actions from calls need to be shared soon after they occur (if there are no decisions why bother having the call).

I’ve been experimenting with sharing [acd](/tag/acd) & [breakout](/tag/breakout) calls in Eth Magicians as wiki posts and updating them with copies of decision writeups/recaps/summary/notes.

The community can then access these all in the one place, either via Eth Magicians directly or from news sources pointing to them (I have been experimenting with this for [Week in Ethereum News](https://weekinethereumnews.com/)).  We can also collate additional info (presentations, audio recordings, writeups).

We should close these topics soon after the calls, as they aren’t the venue for protocol discussions (should happen in Eth R&D Discord) or prior to the specific call (`ethereum/pm` issues for the agenda).  Same for the wiki post, to prevent vandalism.

Perhaps topics could be auto magically created from `ethereum/pm` issues.

I’m also keen for transcripts & chat logs to be made available very quickly after a call (within 24 hours).  These are stored in ethereum/pm repo but take weeks/months rather than hours/days.

#### Templates

I want to see more use of templates.

The EIP template is just starting to be used.  We should do similar for [ERCs](/c/ercs/57), and encourage authors to update their discussion to use the template.

We should also use templates for [Protocol Calls & happenings](/c/protocol-calls/63)

#### Sharing

I’d like to see experiments with social media AI bots sharing individual topics as they are created (similar to [@ethresearchbot](https://x.com/ethresearchbot)) on X/Farcaster or weekly summaries.

#### Volunteer

![:raised_hand:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/raised_hand.png?v=15) I volunteer as tribute, either as a trusted member (so I can close call posts I create) or as a mod.  Though I have very limited time to contribute.

*[Update: I am now a [mod](https://ethereum-magicians.org/about)]*

#### Brand

Eth Magicians (Ethereum + Magicians).  We should drop the word Fellowship and discourage the use of the FEM acronym (acronyms are a barrier).

The logo should be a combination of an Ethereum logo (in yellow/gold) and magic (stars/wand)

Grok 2 mini:

**Introducing a new contender: *where magic meets cuteness with a sprinkle of experimental flair!***

**We all know Ethereum’s magicians aren’t your average wizards—they’re the daring visionaries who make Ethereum *magically* powerful, continuously shipping EIPs and keeping this billion-dollar ecosystem thriving.**

**This new logo captures that very spark, representing the enchanting energy they bring to the blockchain.**

**But that’s not all. Let’s face it—core devs are an undeniably cute bunch. It’s time for the logo to finally reflect that! This new design radiates just the right amount of adorable, showcasing our charm without compromising on credibility:**

[![wizz](https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/c/c3d0384bf993d1df65893b6ae3ecd5ad3189f99f_2_500x500.png)wizz745×745 431 KB](https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/c3d0384bf993d1df65893b6ae3ecd5ad3189f99f)

**When examining the triangle representing the logo trilemma, it’s clear the new design lands perfectly between ‘cute’ and ‘taken seriously.’ I’ll admit, I was initially surprised by this balance, but considering how amazing the logo turned out, it totally makes sense!**

[![wizz_final](https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/original/2X/1/123efb7d1db16a33970b5335a4bffc3b744ca193.png)wizz_final510×350 9.49 KB](https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/123efb7d1db16a33970b5335a4bffc3b744ca193)

**And in true Ethereum spirit, we want to push boundaries and try something fresh. The logo strikes the perfect balance between “yes, we’re serious pioneers” and “hey, we’re also irresistibly cute!” So, get ready for a logo that embodies the magic, quirkiness, and creativity of Ethereum’s finest.**

> Eth Magicians (Ethereum + Magicians). We should drop the word Fellowship and discourage the use of the FEM acronym (acronyms are a barrier).

To follow up on this quote, we tried to drop the word “fellowship” and we actually stopped calling this community “fellowship of ethereum magicians” and called it “ethereum magicians or eth magicians” for quite a while. I tried to find “an official statement” when we dropped the word “fellowship” but the closest I found, is this article that I wrote a while ago:

https://medium.com/ethereum-magicians/ethereum-magicians-magic-culture-ec1fd2e2901

To respond, generally on this thread, I’m really happy that there are these incentives and initiatives as well as proposals on “bringing magicians back to life”. As someone who has poured a lot of efforts into fostering and growing this wonderful community, alongside many others such as [@boris](/u/boris) and a few others. FEM started as a community of people who came, contributed and eventually left. Some of us burned out through constant effort of trying to make improvements and eventually ended up hitting the wall. And the only way to save our sanity was to leave this community. I’m speaking from my own experiences here and from the conversations that I had with a couple of FEM members.

I’d like to throw a few references here to remind everyone what FEM, Eth Magicians used to be and I’d love it the continuous efforts of keeping this amazing community enthusiastic would continue in somewhat similar voice, or at least keep some of the spirit. This is how FEM started, how it differentiated from other groups.

Thank you so much to [@abcoathup](/u/abcoathup) [@bumblefudge](/u/bumblefudge) [@matt](/u/matt) and others for continuous efforts and contributing to the FEM forum as well as keeping this place magical! ![:sparkles:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/sparkles.png?v=12)

**ninjafire** (2024-08-19):

Hello Eth Magicians, I am ninjafire, a ux/ui designer in the space for a few years. I would love to support you with this mission if i can help in any way. For me the first question that pop to my mind is How will you use this logo? Where will you display it?

I am completely new to this forum and I didn’t notice the current logo and where it is already displayed.

**nloureiro** (2024-08-22):

Hey.

I made two variations for the logo. Let me know what you think

This way, users can subscribe to categories they want to keep up to date with, reducing the effort needed to follow Ethereum’s progress.

I love the logo design-off happening here, and I don’t want to distract from it, but one operational detail I’d like to bang on is that ERC is currently a category of its own and Wallets/Browsers/Dapp-front-ends are currently not a category, nor is it obvious which of the 8 categories that topic would be most welcome in.  On desktop, 8 categories displays kinda weird, maybe a 9th would round out the tictactoe table? ![:sweat_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12)

I’m not sure if we call it “Wallets” or “Front-end” or “Web” or just lean into the standards-nerd thing and call it “Presentation Layer” or “User-Agents” (which technically includes browsers, DOMs, extension wallets, and mobile wallets if you think about it!).  But whatever it is, I would volunteer to moderate it and set up a readme/landing page for it and would recommend [@SamWilsn](/u/samwilsn) get mod rights to it as well, since AllWalletDevs is his baby and he knows 100X more than I do about wallets and wallet testing!

**nicocsgy** (2024-08-23):

Hello and welcome,

So you can have a look at this discourse https://sorcerer.discourse.group/ which is a test discourse to try features and designs.

The main `logo` is dispayed on top of the page then you have another logo that can be displayed at the same place during the scrolling (reading) of a thread called `small logo`. And then you have category icons which are displayed on the homepage for each category.

[![image](https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6e78e2f3d8acfd0eae6110e055935dd37e72a6f0_2_550x500.png)image1399×1270 189 KB](https://ethereum-magicians.org/uploads/default/6e78e2f3d8acfd0eae6110e055935dd37e72a6f0)

As you can see we could have a logo for each category and try to make them fit with the category. e.g  :

![](https://ethereum-magicians.org/user_avatar/ethereum-magicians.org/nerolation/48/8553_2.png) Nerolation:

> Let’s face it—core devs are an undeniably cute bunch.

This character logo reminds me of geth team members so I propose it for the `Protocol Calls` category as this is where you can find the core devs.

---

**nicocsgy** (2024-08-23):

Seems very reasonable indeed the 8 categories doesn’t fit the welcome page on desktop. Also, I’m still trying to find a good way to revive the working group category.

For the category name IMO “Wallets” seems like the natural option however it doesn’t cover everything as we’re seeing more and more wallet abstraction and different flows that are not really “Wallets”. So I have no strong opinion on this one your propositions are good. “Front-end” or “Web” might be my favourites.

As for [@SamWilsn](/u/samwilsn) I totally agree, we’ll need his confirmation but that would be great to have both of you to take care of this category as we can expect it to be quite active.

---

**SamWilsn** (2024-08-27):

I am trying to avoid taking on additional moderation-type activities as much as possible ![:sweat_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/sweat_smile.png?v=12)

---

**nicocsgy** (2024-08-30):

Haha fair dodge ![:laughing:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/laughing.png?v=12)

As it seems we’re calling out wallet enjoyers maybe [@ulerdogan](/u/ulerdogan), would you be interested in this ?

**ulerdogan** (2024-08-30):

Would love to take role!

**ninjafire** (2024-09-13):

I have made some tries recently on the Ethereum Magicians logo. I am not able to post any images or link so it is impossible for me to share the designs. If someone has a solution about this i would be really happy to share my work with you haha

You should be able to post 1 image or 2 links as a new user.

If you read a few more topics, then you should be able to share more.

**ninjafire** (2024-09-14):

Alright, thank you [@abcoathup](/u/abcoathup), now i think i am able to share my logo proposition. I didn’t work on the color palette for now but more on the shape of the logo. Please let me know your thoughts about it.

Thanks to all the designers for their submissions, they are beautiful. **Brace yourselves a new logo is coming !**

**tvanepps** (2024-09-20):

ninjafire’s designs are beautifully clean but unfortunately reminiscent of KKK hood folds. If that was modified it would be far and away my choice!

---

**nicocsgy** (2024-09-25):

Hey [@ninjafire](/u/ninjafire),

Your designs are great ! Even though our community couldn’t be further from those groups, outsiders without context could misinterpret. Trent’s concern could be mitigated easily with minor modifications that wouldn’t alter the core ideas of your design. Discussing with protocol  supporters we came with some ideas (applying one of them would be enough I think) :

- Slightly modify the hat so it’s put on top of the glyph logo, like if the glyph was wearing the hat. This could be with a very small circle around the upper part of the glyph.
- Slightly moving the star from the logo to the pointy edge of the hat. With a slightly different fold to represent the weight of the star a bit like this hat:
