# Small suggested change to EIP 1

I’ve been thinking of proposing a small change to EIP 1.

Many of the EIPs I see seem to give no consideration to what happens if the broadly used. People seem to think that the amount of resources available on the network (particularly hard drive space) is infinite, and given recent discussions re: rent, I think this is obviously not the case.

If the ethos of the community was that an EIP must be not only useful and needed, but it also must be _and efficient, and not destroy the network if it succeeds. I’ll probably make this PR soon, but I thought I’d see what other thinks first.

Here’s my proposed change to EIP 1: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/compare/master...tjayrush:master

Comments welcome.

Yes! Along the lines of the “backwards compatibility” discussion item, there should be a “network effects” discussion item
