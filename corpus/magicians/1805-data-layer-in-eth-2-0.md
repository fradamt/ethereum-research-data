# Data Layer in ETH 2.0

I had some interesting ideas I brought up in [this](https://ethresear.ch/t/actors-and-assets-in-ethereum-2-0/4117) ETH research thread that tie in with the data ring: data structures, how data is stored, storage rent, etc.

The TL;DR is that IMO the data and execution layers (together, the data model) aren’t that well formalized yet, and I think there is some opportunity for improvement as we transition to ETH 2.0

We should try and get some work going on this so we can help with this aspect of the spec.
