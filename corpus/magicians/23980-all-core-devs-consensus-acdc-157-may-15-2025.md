**ACDC #157 Summary**

**Action items**

- Continue work towards fusaka-devnet-0

To be launched 26 May

**Summary**

Pectra

- Pectra upgrade completed successfully
- Trent published Pectra perspectives from various core contributors

Pectra Pages — Stateful Works
- Call for additional perspective submissions remains open

Pari conducting analysis on blob increase following Pectra; report forthcoming

⠀Fusaka

- peerdas-devnet-7 launched; currently stable
- Client teams primarily working on implementing BPO support
- fusaka-devnet-0 ; aim for 26 May launch

https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/fusaka-devnet-0
- Includes PeerDAS, BPO, and MODEXP gas cost increase EIPs

We touched on validator custody implementation and any potential spec complexity

- Async followup on Discord

⠀ACD Restructuring Proposal

- Tim proposed reorganizing All Core Devs meetings:

ACDT to focus on current fork N
- ACDE/C to focus on future fork N+1

Key discussion points:

- Need for broader community input earlier in process
- Concern about splitting attention between current and future forks
- Proposal to formalize working group reviews

Proposed Timeline Structure for ACDE/C

- Initial month for high-level fork focus discussion
- Agreement on main features by early July
- Core feature development alongside Fusaka work
- Integration of smaller EIPs later

Marchill raised the need for a new ACD forum to improve community involvement

- Participants leaned towards improving Ethereum Magicians, but agreed for a better way to surface input, and track R&D process of an EIP from proposal to mainnet.
