### Meeting Summary:

The meeting focused on a presentation about the compatibility between Fossil and EPBS (Eth2 client software). The presenter explained how EPBS’s payload separation feature can be useful for Fossil, particularly regarding payload constraints that shouldn’t affect the beacon chain. The meeting encountered technical difficulties with screen sharing, but the presenter was able to demonstrate the presentation slides to the attendees.
