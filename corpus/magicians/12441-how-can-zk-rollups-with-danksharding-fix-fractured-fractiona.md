# How can zk-rollups with danksharding fix fractured/fractional liquidity

Recently, on a Bankless Shows’ Podcast, Justin Drake mentioned that zk-rollups with danksharding will help fix the problem of fractional liquidity. Given the nuance off an “opt-in” option, where can I find more information about this ?

This statement is lacking most of the context needed to explain it. I *suspect* it has to do with one of Vitalik’s proposals for a “can’t be evil” yet privacy-preserving CEX:
