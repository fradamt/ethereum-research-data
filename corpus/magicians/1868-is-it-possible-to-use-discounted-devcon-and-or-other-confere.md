# Is it possible to use discounted Devcon (and / or other conferences) tickets to incentivise mining on a PoW test network

Right now there is no incentive to mine on the test net, we can’t give the tokens value by making them fungible as someone could just come along and 51% attack it. What if instead it was agreed that mining a certain amount of test ETH on a new PoW test net would allow you to purchase conference tickets at a reduced rate?
