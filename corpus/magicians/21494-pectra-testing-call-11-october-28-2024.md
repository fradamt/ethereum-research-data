### Peerdas

*peerdas-devnet-3*

possibly wait for pectra-devnet-5 launch before we relaunch devnet 4. Lets wait for the final spec to be released, before finishing up implementations.
- Wait for breakout room discussion for decision.

### EOF - Fusaka

*eof-devnet-0 -  fusaka-devnet-0*

- rebased on alpha 8 - built on top of devnet 4 spec
- osakaTime as the fork activation
- launch in ~ 1 week time
- Besu - is ready
- Reth - osaka is ready
- Nethermind - osaka is ready
- Will do some testing this week to see if we could launch an EL only devnet before Devcon.
