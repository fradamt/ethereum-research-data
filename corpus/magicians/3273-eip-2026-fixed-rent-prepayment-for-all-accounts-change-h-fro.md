Hey, I wondered if you saw [my comment](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2026#issuecomment-493642487) on the PR. I guess I should have posted it here.

Yes, I saw your comment, thank you. I have added some clarification to the EIP itself, since I did not find a good way to respond on the PR comments
