# Ethcode - the vscode plugin for Ethereum

Hello everyone,

We are a small team building Ethcode a vscode plugin for ethereum smart contract development. We have been working on this tool for many months now.

**[Ethcode](https://github.com/ethential/ethcode) has some amazing abilities that vscode users might have been missing:**

- Compile solidity, Vyper
- Deploy compiled contracts
- Call functions, create transactions
- Sign transactions locally with your keys
- Deploy transactions to Test and Main network
