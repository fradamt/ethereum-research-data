# EIP3091 and L2's

How should we deal with EIP3091 when it comes to L2’s? Block is not used anymore and replaced with batch.

IMHO we should create a new standard without block (and maybe token) - as far as I see only tx and address are really used in the wild anyway.

Or has anyone seen usages of block and token in the wild?
