# Developer Education Sharing Repo

We had a great event at the council the other day about Developer Education. We all agreed that open sourcing some information around types of lessons, timing, lesson plans, etc. would help us all do better in keeping up to date with new information, as well as improve the quality of our offerings to our students.

I was wondering if anyone had the notes from that sub-ring gathering?

The Chainshot crew added an open source Tutorial Builder! Check it out!

Could be a great resource for local workshops!
