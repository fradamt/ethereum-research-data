# Will the ETH test currency on the Ropsten chain return to zero?

Ropsten testnet is due to switch off PoW forever (the Merge) around June 8.

Testnet Ether has no value.

Thank you very much, sir, what will happen to the Ethereum test currency on the kiln chain after the kiln testnet merges with the mainnet? Will it be mapped into real Ethereum?

NO! Testnet Ether has no value.

Whether it is Kiln, Ropsten, Rinkeby, Goerli, Sepolia, Kovan, testnet Ether is worth zero.
