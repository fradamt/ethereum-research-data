# Last call on EIP 1167

The authors of EIP 1167 have requested it be moved to Last Call, meaning everyone has 2 weeks to read and comment before it’s considered for Finalisation.

Please give your feedback!

Perhaps an EIPs/Last Call subcategory would be useful? What do you think [@Arachnid](/u/arachnid) [@jpitts](/u/jpitts)?

I do think the site can help in getting the word out on last calls.

What I’ve been doing is using the “Action Item”. I’ll add a new one, same color red, called “Last Call” under EIPs.
