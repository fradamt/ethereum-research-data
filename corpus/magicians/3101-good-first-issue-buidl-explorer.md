# Good first issue BUIDL Explorer

I found BUIDL Explorer on Product Hunt https://www.producthunt.com/posts/buidl-explorer

It’s a tool that links different Ethereum projects on GitHub, especially highlighting issues that are “good first issue”.

I’ve had this challenge myself in promoting EthMagicians issues.

This seems like a good way to promote how to get started, especially for non-code tasks.

Also, diving into Product Hunt again inspired me to put more time into that community to surface Ethereum related projects and services — and makers!

I’m going to mention this to Eth Cat Herders too, as they are the source of a lot of issues that are non-code.

Also this definitely is for developers, too! I want to see us onboard more open source contributors.
