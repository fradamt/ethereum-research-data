# Naming Conventions

[EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1) doesn’t specify how naming conventions are developed and propagated. Discussions are bubbling about naming [upgrades](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-roadmapping-improvements/6653/11) and [branches](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/4945). And EIPs, like [this one](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-4974-fungible-non-tradable-tokens-or-exp/8805), run into issues of how much to align with existing standards.

Should there be a broader, systemic way to address these questions? How important or unimportant is it?
