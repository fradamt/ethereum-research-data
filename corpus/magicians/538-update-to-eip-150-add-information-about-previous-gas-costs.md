# Update to EIP-150: Add information about previous gas costs

This is a proposed update to [EIP-150](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-150.md) by [@chfast](/u/chfast).

“Because Yellow Paper only describes the latest mainnet hard fork, there is not official source of information were the gas costs before the changes of EIP-150 are provided.”
