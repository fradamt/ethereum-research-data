# About the Tooling category

The Tooling category is for teams building developer tools.

It began with this thread:



    ![](https://ethereum-magicians.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/y/34f0e0/48.png)
    [Creation of Devtool ring](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/creation-of-devtool-ring/1833) [Tooling](/c/tooling/29)



> After a technical discussion with Truffle team about having a standardization around debugging support, it might worth setting up a ring involving teams building developer tools.
> I m sure we will find plenty of other topics (like the standardization of the vm trace).
> Make sense?
