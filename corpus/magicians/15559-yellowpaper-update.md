# Yellowpaper update

hey everyone, I would like to make an effort to keep the yellow paper up to date as it is an important document,

is there any ongoing initiative on this?

It’s an exactly valuable effort. Looks like there is an encouragement by Tim Beiko to update the Yellowpaper and also a [recommendation](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/pull/890) to apply an ESP grant, sharing in case if it’s unnoticed.

I’ve opened a new thread to keep track of everything

> Another reason I want to do that is because other chains tend to change the consensus and keep the execution mostly the same, this way this yellowpaper-EL could still be useful for more than Ethereum
