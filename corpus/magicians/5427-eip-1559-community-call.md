Here’s a very helpful tweet-storm covering what was discussed by EIP-1559 champion [@timbeiko](/u/timbeiko).

  Oops, @hasufl is last: Ethereum exists to serve users and holders. If Ethereum overpays for security, it is fine for the network to lower security. Also, we've seen much stronger declines that 1559 in mining revenue, and BTC + ETH were fine.

Thank you for arranging this. Would love if we could have another panel with a few less members where we can review the points for or against the proposals we’ve put forward. BBT has a very good presentation with a lot of research that should be reviewed.
