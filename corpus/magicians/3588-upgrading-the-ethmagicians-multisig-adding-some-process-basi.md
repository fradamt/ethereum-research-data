# Upgrading the EthMagicians multisig, adding some process / basic rules

This is a thread for extended discussion on extending the multisig holders for the EthMagicians wallet:

https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/issues/68

TLDR [@meknab](/u/meknab) & [@Flash](/u/flash) are being added.

[@meknab](/u/meknab) has some basic rules that she will document.

We are likely to have some other things to discuss related to Osaka and ongoing.
