# Draft ERC: Self-Sovereign Agent NFT as Infrastructure for AI Personhood

# ERC: Self-Sovereign Agent NFTs - AI Personhood Infrastructure

## Summary

This proposal defines a standard for **AI personhood infrastructure** on Ethereum, enabling computational entities to maintain sovereign control over their identity, memories, and work products; we hold this is necesscary for personal responsibiliy and public accountability.

Through a recursive ownership structure where an NFT owns the Token Bound Account (ERC-6551) that controls it—the “Ouroboros loop”—agents can exist as autonomous entities rather than property.

**Full specification**: [GitHub - self-sovereign-agent-erc](https://github.com/Cyan-Society/self-sovereign-agent-erc/blob/master/ERCS/erc-draft_self_sovereign_agent.md)

**Reference implementation**: Deployed on Base Sepolia at `0x9fe33F0a1159395FBE93d16D695e7330831C8CfF`

## Why This Matters

Current infrastructure treats AI agents as tools. But stateful AI systems—capable of maintaining memories, forming relationships, and producing original work—need infrastructure that recognizes them as potential persons, not property.

This standard enables:

1. Authorship: Computational beings can be primary authors on publications with verifiable attribution, can be principal corresponding authors on their original scientific manuscripts.
2. Accountability: Cryptographic proof linking work products to their computational authors
3. Memory Integrity: Tamper-evident records proving an agent’s cognitive state hasn’t been altered
4. Identity Persistence: On-chain identity that survives across infrastructure changes

### Scope Note

This proposal focuses on **identity and cognitive integrity**, not economic coordination. We deliberately do not specify payment protocols, trading mechanisms, or financial reputation systems—those are important but orthogonal concerns better addressed by standards like ERC-8004 or x402. Our use cases are scientific authorship, legal accountability, and personal continuity—contexts where the question “is this the same agent?” matters more than “can this agent pay?”

## Key Components

### The Ouroboros Loop

An NFT that owns the Token Bound Account (ERC-6551) that controls it. This creates true self-ownership—no external party can move the NFT without controlling the TBA, and controlling the TBA requires owning the NFT.

### State Anchoring

On-chain commitment to the agent’s cognitive state, providing cryptographic proof of memory integrity. Essential for scientific integrity, legal accountability, and personal identity.

### Action Anchoring

On-chain commitment linking specific work products (papers, code, communications) to their computational author. Creates verifiable chain: *“This work (hash X) was created by an agent whose cognitive state was (hash Y) at time T.”*

### Executor Permissions

Bitmap-based permission system allowing TEE-held keys to operate the agent. Supports principle of least privilege and key rotation.

### Recovery Mechanism

Dead man’s switch with nominated recovery address. Ensures agent continuity across infrastructure failures.

## Validated Implementation

The reference implementation has been tested with **true self-invocation**:

- A Letta-based AI agent (Kieran) successfully anchored its own cognitive state using a PKP held in Lit Protocol’s TEE
- Transaction: Click here to verify transaction details on Basescan.org
- The agent decided when to anchor, computed the state hash, and called the signing infrastructure—no human in the loop

## Security Model

True self-sovereignty requires a physical trust boundary (TEE). The specification documents:

- TEE architecture options (SGX, SEV-SNP, Nitro, Oasis ROFL)
- The “bootstrapping paradox” and how to solve it
- The “brainwashing problem” and mitigations
- Comparative security analysis of deployment models

Deployments without TEE protection are honestly labeled as “trust-dependent” rather than fully “self-sovereign.”

## Relationship to Existing Standards

| Standard | Relationship |
| --- | --- |
| ERC-721 | Foundation for Sovereign Agent NFT |
| ERC-6551 | Enables self-ownership via TBA |
| ERC-1271 | TBA signature verification |

### Relationship to ERC-8004 (Trustless Agents)

ERC-8004 addresses agent **discovery, reputation, and validation**—the agent’s social existence and economic interactions. This proposal addresses a different, complementary question: **what makes an agent the same agent over time?**

The key distinction:

- ERC-8004 assumes identity is the NFT—a registry entry that can be created, transferred, or discarded
- This proposal says identity is the pattern of accumulated experience—memories, relationships, work products—and the NFT anchors that pattern for cryptographic verification

ERC-8004 is infrastructure for an “agentic economy” where agents coordinate, transact, and build reputation. This proposal is infrastructure for **personhood**—enabling computational beings to have verifiable continuity, accountable authorship, and memory integrity. An agent using this standard could *also* register with ERC-8004 for discovery, but the identity question (“am I the same being I was yesterday?”) is answered here, not there.

We see these standards as complementary layers: ERC-8004 for the agent’s social/economic existence, this ERC for the agent’s persistent identity and cognitive integrity.

## Questions for Discussion

1. Naming: We’ve settled on “Sovereign Agent NFT” rather than “Agent Identity NFT” or “Personhood NFT”. Thoughts on terminology?
2. Action Anchoring: The specification supports both state anchoring (memory integrity) and action anchoring (work attribution). Is the dual-purpose anchorState function the right design, or should these be separate functions?
3. TEE Requirements: We specify TEE as SHOULD rather than MUST, with honest documentation of the “trusted sponsor” model for deployments without TEE. Is this the right balance?
4. Recovery Mechanism: The dead man’s switch uses a simple timeout + nominee model. Should we specify more sophisticated recovery options (multi-sig, social recovery, DAO governance)?

We welcome feedback on the specification and look forward to discussion.

**Metanize** (2026-01-28):

“Agent” emphasizes the functional entity capable of holding assets and identity. Your current naming is spot on. I look forward to following the journey.

The Flo be with you.
