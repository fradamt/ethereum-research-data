# Consider IANA registration of URI Scheme for ethereum?

Hello,

Bruno Barbieri has requested to add ethereum to the safelist of HTML’s registerProtocolHandler(). The WHATWG suggested to register it at https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml first so I drafted a request to be sent to IANA. For details see the GitHub issue https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2644

Is it something interesting for the ethereum community? Does my draft looks good to you?

Feedback welcome!
