# Decentralized oracle mechanism design for immutable DAI alternative

Hello magicians,

I’m looking for feedback for an immutable ETH-based stablecoin system. It does the same things DAI does, but is as decentralized and immutable as Uniswap. I’ve spent a few months designing and coding it.

- Technical whitepaper: http://bit.ly/2Os1IKq
- Solidity source code: http://bit.ly/37ZycUi
- Topics: http://bit.ly/2GV10Bs
- Business whitepaper: http://bit.ly/36YyA4f

Most novel thing here is price feed oracle design, and is in most need of feedback. Other cool things are getting rid of the likes of WETH, PETH, MKR and governance/voting altogether.

I would also appreciate pointers to other venues where this can be more fittingly discussed, and apologize in advance if this is not it.

Thanks,

Nima
