i’m planning to be at ETH Denver and I’d really like to give a short presentation on [ERC-7529](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7529) if this ends up happening

Can’t wait to attend the event and share my thoughts on zk

We are ready to participate in the event to share our share of omnichain interoperability solutions.

I would love to present my EIP-7543

I would like to present a soon-to-be-filed RIP for a new trace precompile being drafted by Forta and OpenZeppelin that will enable a new class of on-chain security solutions

**jaczkal** (2024-01-13):

Not sure 100% if I will be there, but at least I could find someone who could take it… about [ERC-7512: Onchain Representation for Audits](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7512)

**alextnetto.eth** (2024-01-13):

I’d like to contribute as a volunteer and as a speaker about a soon-to-be-filed EIP (I will edit this post asap).

I’ll already be at ETH Denver, as well as a speaker about DAOs and human coordination.

Excited to attend, and would love to help support or coordinate!

Thank you so much for your interest in this event! I will DM those who replied to this thread shortly to coordinate speaking slots as well as organisation details!

It seems that the vote is closed, but I’m happy to share and give a short presentation on [ERC6672](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6672) if this is happening!

This sounds great! Myself and another co-author of [ERC-7571: Shadow Events](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7571-shadow-events/17134) would love to present / host a workshop

Friday 1Mar? I don’t have my exact dates but that’s probably the easiest day for me to commit to thus far

---

**alvinh** (2024-01-29):

Agree, Friday Mar 1st would work best for us as well

---

**matt** (2024-01-29):

How about separate EIP and ERC tracks? ![:smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/smile.png?v=12)

---

**TtheBC01** (2024-01-29):

Friday would be great

---

**halbstein-x** (2024-01-30):

This sounds great! Would love to help if needed

In case there is any confusion, RollCall is also the name of the L2 standards calls.

We’ve been using “rollcall” as “who’s coming” abbreviation ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12)
