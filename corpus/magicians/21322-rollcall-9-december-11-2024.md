# RollCall #9, December 11, 2024

#### Agenda

[RollCall #9 · Issue #1172 · ethereum/pm · GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1172); moderated by [@CarlBeek](/u/carlbeek)

#### Summary

*(Copied from Eth R&D [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/829412277782315008/1316695343320006726))*

- Pectra scope is almost final (see EIP-7600). earliest it will happen in March/April 2025.
- EIP-7702 will be included in Pectra. spec is almost final, no big changes expected.
- Pectra will increase target/max block count from 3/6 to 6/9 (i.e. base fee can change -14% ~ +8% in each block). more throughput for DA!
- there’s a proposal EIP-7762 to set a floor price for blob base fee so that it does not fluctuate that much during price discovery. based on this call this EIP probably won’t be included in Pectra.
- discussed some possible changes to how blob gas is tracked in the eth_feeHistory API. it seems most rollups don’t use this API extensively.
- “Common Core” discussion (aka L2ECC) is still ongoing, the next breakout call will happen on 22 Jan, and there is a working group Telegram channel.
