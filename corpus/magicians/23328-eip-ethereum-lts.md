# EIP: Ethereum LTS

Given the recent testnet complications, I present a solution clarifying the stability of Ethereum networks by classifying them as Long-Term Support (LTS) or Bleading-Edge (BE). Developers should not have the ground torn up from beneath them. LTS nets will work forever and never change, while BE nets will have the latest features.
