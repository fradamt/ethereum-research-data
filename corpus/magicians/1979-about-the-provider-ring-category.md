# About the Provider Ring category

This Ring is to coordinate between developers of providers, APIs which provide access to Ethereum nodes.

See the [charter wiki](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Constrained-Resource-Client-Ring) for more information.

This is the inaugural thread on the Forum: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/forming-a-ring-provider-ring/1852

Looks like you got a wrong link, it should be [this](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Provider-Ring) link to the Provider Ring charter wiki instead.
