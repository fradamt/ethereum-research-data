**poojaranjan** (2023-12-07):

My 2 cents on the proposal:

- Historically, we have added the last upgrade Meta in the “Requires” section along with EIPs to be deployed in the current upgrade.
 I’d suggest including EIP-7568 which is currently in a PR. Also, promoting EIP-7568 to reach the Final status sooner.
- Update “EIP description” to  “EIPs included in the Deneb-Cancun Ethereum network upgrade” to make it look Deneb and Cancun inclusive and not optional like “Constantinople/St. Petersburg”.
 It’s a weak preference, but I suppose since this is the first Meta EIP to include a two-layer upgrade, it will create a good practice in writing descriptions.
