# Interact with your Smart Contracts [eth-blockchain-helper]

Hi everyone!

I’m developing an npm package to help interact with Smart Contracts on the EVM platform (Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon,…). My package help clarifies the workflow of transaction through 3 steps below:

- Create raw transaction
- Sign raw transaction
- Send raw transaction

So, you can integrate it into your Frontend and Backend both, this helps your DApp minimize, clarify modules and help for customizing transactions.

In the future, I will develop more utils and tools for Web3 in many next versions.

Using and feedback for me: [eth-blockchain-helper - npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eth-blockchain-helper)

Many thanks!
