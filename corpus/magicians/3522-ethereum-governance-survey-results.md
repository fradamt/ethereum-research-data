Interesting digits, next time I would like to see number of people who mostly use decentralized technologies in their daily life. Who completely declined using centralized technologies, etc. And which technologies  in the current stack they wish to be decentralized at the first place.

And one question. What is CT?

P.S. And thanks for Week in Ethereum.
