# ERC7231:Identity aggregated NFT

This standard extends ERC-721 by binding individuals’ Web2 and Web3 identities to non-fungible tokens (SBTs included). By binding multiple identities, aggregated and composible identity infomation can be verified, resulting in more beneficial onchain scenarios for individuals, such as self-authentication, social overlapping, commercial value generation from user targetting, etc. By adding a custom schema in the metadata, and updating and verifying the schema hash in the contract, the binding of NFT and identity information is completed.

The URL to the proposal is as follows
