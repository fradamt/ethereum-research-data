# Splitable Utility NFT Token for ERC-721

An standard aimed towards deploying multi-utility NFT’s easier.

Our idea is to initially create a single token initially that can/will give access to all the utilities it’s programmed to do then, later on token holder can transfer any utility he owns to someone else. At the time of transfer if the NFT contains only one utility it will get transferred but if there are more than one utilities the a new NFT will be minted to receiver for the utility he got.

ps: It’s not multi token standard, as there will be single token for all utilities not ‘a’ token for each utility.
