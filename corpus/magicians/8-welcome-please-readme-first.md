# Welcome! Please README first!

# Hello  Welcome to the Ethereum Magicians forum

Ethereum Magicians is a forum for the crypto community to have a place where anyone can join, create topic and discuss mainly about EIPs and technical difficulties of Ethereum ecosystem. Or in another words “Ethereum Magicians forum is a place on the internet where your voice will be heard and your contributions to the Ethereum will matter”. Ethereum Magicians is a group of individuals working and contributing to the Ethereum.

## What to do on a forum?

- Read and discuss about Ethereum
- Create topic
- Form a working group
- Share prototype, code, graph and ask for feedback
- Attend discussions and in-person meetings

## First time on Ethereum Magicians forum?

If you’re the first time on the Ethereum Magicians forum, please check out our [New Member Guide](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/New-Member-Guide) where are explained terms that we are using on this forum and will give you a lot of answers to questions regarding this forum and Ethereum Magicians in general.

## History of Ethereum Magicians

Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (FEM) was founded to solve problem of offline and online coordination in Ethereum. We started an open forum with a focus on improving Ethereum without unwanted noise (that social media like Twitter and Reddit provides). FEM is Fellowship of individuals with a common goal - Improve Ethereum.

If you’re interested in reading more of the history of FEM, read [this Medium article](https://medium.com/ethereum-magicians/fellowship-of-the-ethereum-magicians-8711d4d781a6) from [@pet3rpan](/u/pet3rpan)

Who are the magicians? the EIP authors?

What is the full scope of our mission here?

Does our mission involve solving a specific problem at this time? If we are successful at that, will the fellowship be disbanded?

[@fulldecent](/u/fulldecent), the proposed mission is described in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xzBymEOGdcpc7kwVGXECFReKmnAZ1WDj6KI81X4Exf0/edit

The scope is as big as it needs to be.

The Fellowship is not solving one problem in particular; rather, it serves as a communication and decision-making process in order to produce better EIPs.

See “EIP Types” in EIP-1 for what might be discussed in Fellowship councils: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md#eip-types

Many organizations of this nature are forming as DAOs. Others are committing to [progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/) over time, such as [Sky Mavis](https://axie.substack.com/p/community?s=r) and [Forte](https://forte.io/#company).

Several recently discussed EIPs ([ERC-4671 Non-Tradable Tokens](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-4671-non-tradable-token/7976), [ERC-4824 DAOs](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-4824-decentralized-autonomous-organizations/8362), and perhaps my proposed [EXP](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-exp-fungible-non-tradable-tokens/8805)) may allow groups to decentralize decision-making and incentivize efforts without becoming financially-driven. Doing so with Ethereum Magicians could serve as a test case for future community governance structures in the Ethereum ecosystem and beyond.

Since Ethereum is creating the ecosystem for new organizations to work this way, should the group that manages Ethereum contributions “dogfood” our efforts? Is that something worth aspiring towards in the governing documents? I’m not sure, and generally curious how others think about this.

How can I create my own topic to begin discussion on it?

---

**theBigRevolution** (2024-12-24):

Hey did you get a resolution

---

**abcoathup** (2024-12-25):

In order to be able to create a topic you need to spend some time here, read topics on the areas that you want to discuss.

If you still run into issues after a few days of reading, you can ping me and I will look into it.

Letters from ethereum-magicians get to spam folder!

I have mail [u59149403@proton.me](mailto:u59149403@proton.me) . Mails from ethereum-magicians have “[noreply@184.169.209.62](mailto:noreply@184.169.209.62)” in “From” field. I. e. you use bare IP address instead of proper DNS name! These letters go to spam folder. I mark them as not spam, but they still get there. I tried to add your email to my address book, but I got message that I cannot add this mail to address book. (I assume this is because this is bare IP address).

So, please, do something! I think you should switch to proper DNS

As Ethereum magician has world class engineers, contributors and deeply involved in tech, they give better feedback, suggetions to new Ideas, Usecases to build on ethereum or L2s.

Should we have some kind of “Idea” or “Demo” Page on Ethereum magician, where any dev, team, companies can put about their Ideas, Demos to get technical feedback, understanding better way?

**Mattia** (2025-08-13):

Hello everyone,

I am posting on behalf of my friend **-** regarding an unresolved issue from the original Ethereum Presale in July 2014. We are seeking any guidance or contact with someone who can help verify and resolve this matter.

**Summary:**

- G. purchased 200 ETH during the presale on July 23, 2014.
- His Bitcoin payment was confirmed on the blockchain (see TXID below).
- At Step 6 of the purchase process, his browser failed to allow the .json wallet download.
- The wallet file was never received by email — not in inbox, not in spam/junk.
- This is not a lost password case: the file itself was never generated/delivered.

**Details:**

- BTC Transaction ID: 55e8320c2f690767bee9a89aaa44679723b84d77bd67d479d9a26d592c3e55d5
- Email used for purchase: signore@anche.no
- Primary contact email: -
- Ethereum address assigned at the time: 143d536b8b1cb84f56a39e0bc81fd5442bcacce1
- Purchase date: July 23, 2014

This issue was reported immediately to the presale helpdesk back in 2014 (we still have the full correspondence), but no solution was ever provided. The funds were received by the presale BTC address, but without the `.json` wallet file, the purchased ETH has never been accessible.

We understand the presale ended more than 10 years ago, but we are kindly asking:

1. For official confirmation that this transaction exists in the presale ledger.
2. For advice or contact with someone at Ethereum Foundation who can help address a missing wallet delivery from 2014.

We can provide receipts, screenshots, and the original email threads from 2014 if needed.

Thank you in advance for any help or guidance.

[@Apriloracle](/u/apriloracle) Welcome to Eth Magicians.  ![:waving_hand:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/waving_hand.png?v=15)

Generally you need to read multiple topics & replies before you can create a topic.  I have manually bumped your permissions.

Thank you, I have read a bunch of stuff, great information here TBH.
