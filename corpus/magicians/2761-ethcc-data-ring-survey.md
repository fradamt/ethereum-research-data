# ETHCC data ring survey

Hi guys,

I was discussing with Ed regarding conducting a survey before the EthCC data-ring discussions (similar to  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iWjqyA_Ylg5szvQnYFrR-N0H_9mshM8ZU88c1fxlalI/edit and https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PS0k9MaKPdPwEw3Uh9rq7USjq7LcSpT6ICQUXRij4YE/edit) . The goal is to have more “data” points while performing the data-ring discussions.

I have made a google form and would be great if we can spread it around: https://goo.gl/forms/Xt3fdiQHzNGaaus63

[@tjayrush](/u/tjayrush), [@jpitts](/u/jpitts) what do you think?

Thanks for organizing this [@ankitchiplunkar](/u/ankitchiplunkar)!

I noticed that the Data Ring does not have an entry in the scrolls, the result of this survey can inform how the ring charter is written.

[@jpitts](/u/jpitts) my pleasure ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)

Do you know what is the best mechanism to spread this form around?

IMO here is best, we should Tweet about it as well.

Have tweeted the google form link https://twitter.com/ankitchiplunkar/status/1100843121452158977 would be great if you guys can retweet it.

Two things you might add:

- An open question, e.g. “Is there anything you’d like to see discussed?” this way people can let the group know if they have additional things to consider.
- Brief explanation of the group, or a link to Jay’s original post Is There Interest in a Data Ring?
