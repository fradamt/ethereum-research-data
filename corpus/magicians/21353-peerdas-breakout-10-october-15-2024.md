- Client teams have been investigating various sync issues on peerdas-devnet-3 . Some clients are functional on the main fork (Prysm, Lodestar etc).
- There is a proposal to launch the next devnet with only supernodes as an immediate step. For now, teams will continue to debug the current devnet for another 1-2 weeks.
- Issue raised regarding KZG verification time during sync (Prysm) and batching the verification seems to significantly improve this.
- Client teams to review Katya’s DAS metrics PR and provide feedback
