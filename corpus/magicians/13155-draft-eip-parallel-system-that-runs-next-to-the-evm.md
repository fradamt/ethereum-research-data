# Draft EIP: parallel system that runs next to the EVM

This EIP proposes a gasless system for that runs next to the EVM. This system has no native currency so all currencies should be made using smart contracts. The proposed system aims to prevent gas fees using a reputation based system.

As an added bonus smart contracts in this system are in python.

This is still a work in progress and no where near close enough for production.

This EIP has been abandoned. Ignore it.
