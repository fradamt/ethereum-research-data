# [WhiSpeG] Marking EIP-627 as final

Hi all,

As discussed during the last Whisper working group call, I am an easily confused individual, and I’ve been confused by the status of [EIP-627](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-627.md) as a draft.

I opened a pull request to change the status to Final:



      [github.com/ethereum/EIPs](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1659)

      `master` ← `atoulme:patch-1`

EIP 627 has been effectively final for a bit. The status of Draft confuses peopl[…](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1659)e (including, maybe exclusively, me). Propose to move to Final.
