# [HELP] Volunteers needed for Council of Paris 2019

**We’re looking for more volunteers** to help with the organization of Magicians Gathering **for** **Council of Paris 2019**.

https://ethereumevents.global/events/2019-council-of-paris/

If you’re from Paris or coming to ETHCC2019 in early March join us at the Magician Council, be part of it and help us make this event better.

**What you’ll be doing:**

- setting/unsetting the venue
- provide assistance at check-in
- provide any other help needed during the day

This event is scheduled for March 4th, 2019. It would be good that you can be available the day before.

We very much appreciate your help and won’t leave you empty handed. Thanks to Asseth and [@jdetychey](/u/jdetychey) All volunteers from the Magicians Gathering will receive a **Free ticket for ETHCC2019!**

**How to apply?**

Just reach out to me via DM ![:wink:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=12)

Thanks, and see you in Paris!
