# Updating Ethereum Magicians Categories - Late 2022

[@matt](/u/matt) has some ideas about improving our categorization to better separate core EIPs from ERCs, this topic is to track this set of changes for late 2022.

Also, for reference, this is similar work done in 2021: [Updating Ethereum Magicians Categories - 2021](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/updating-ethereum-magicians-categories-2021/5813)

I think it would be good to split EIPs and ERCs.

A subcategory for linking from EIPs in the repo to discuss would be good, with templates suggesting what to post.

- Core EIPs

EIP discussion

ERCs

- ERC discussion
- Ideas
