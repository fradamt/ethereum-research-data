# How successful are “listed” smart contracts, dapps and/or tokens on Ethereum?

I am a university researcher (See https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/people/researchers/pieter-hartel/ ). I am asking you, as a developer on Ethereum, to spend 15 minutes of your time to complete an anonymous questionnaire on the **success of smart contracts**. I am hoping to learn what makes smart contracts successful and I promise to share the results with you via a followup post. Please find the link to the questionnaire here: https://utwentebs.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0lm2Lfu84u0lurH
