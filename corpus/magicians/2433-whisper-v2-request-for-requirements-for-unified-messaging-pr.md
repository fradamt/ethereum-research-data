# Whisper v2: Request for requirements for unified messaging protocol - X-Post to ethresear.ch

Hey folks,

In an effort to expand on our efforts and include the community at large around Whisper, [@Ethernian](/u/ethernian) has posted to ethresear.ch a first post asking for feedback and comments on how messaging will work under the new ETH 2.0 paradigm.

The [post](https://ethresear.ch/t/whisper-v2-request-for-requirements-for-eth2-unified-messaging-protocol/4808) is here. Your feedback and thoughts are very welcome.

Updated the title to better reflect the topic. I’ve seen this on reddit and other forums, often it is a good idea to indicate the “primary post” of an X-Post in the title.

Guys, I would like to submit for topic “Whisper v2: Unified Ethereum Secure Messaging” on [Magicians Council in Paris 2019](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/council-of-paris-2019-announcement/2438).

I would like to discuss …

- What do Ethereum Projects expect from Secure Messaging and why they are re-implementing it?
- What should be improved on whisper in order to make it convenient to use for most ethereum projects?
- //open for other aspects

In order to get a time slot we need to present enough people interested in the discussion.

Please ![:hearts:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/hearts.png?v=9) the post to signal your interest.

Hi [@Ethernian](/u/ethernian) thanks for starting this discussion (I know it’s a late reply)

I’m investigating the use of Whisper to implement private securities trading for a current and future consulting clients, and also to coordinate cross-chain swaps, sidechannels, and similar beasts.

I’ll respond to the original topic.
