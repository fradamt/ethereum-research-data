# Requesting feedback on Yellow Paper Shangai update

Hi everyone!

I’ve created a [PR to update the Yellow Paper to Shanghai](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/pull/906), unfortunately it has been stuck for more than 3 weeks now, because maintainers currently don’t have the bandwidth to review it.

If you have some time and are used to the YP formalism, I would really appreciate that you give me some feedback on the PR.

In a more general subject, and because I’m panning to implement Cancun update next, it could be great to also discuss of ways to better maintain that repo.

PS: I’m not blaming the maintainers here, they are probably understaffed and have many other things to handle.
