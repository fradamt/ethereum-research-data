# About the Mobile Ring category

The Mobile Ring is to get native mobile dapps, mobile dapp browsers, and wallets working together well on mobile.

Note: The [Mobile Wallet Ring](https://ethereum-magicians.org/c/working-groups/mobile-wallet-ring) is a subring of this ring and the [Wallet Ring](https://ethereum-magicians.org/c/working-groups/wallet).

For more information, please see the [Mobile Ring Charter](https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/wiki/Mobile-Ring) on the Wiki.
