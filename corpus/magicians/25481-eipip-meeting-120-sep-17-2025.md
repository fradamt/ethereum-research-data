### Meeting Summary:

The team discussed adding Mercy as an editor, with Sam requesting clear input on whether to include her. Akash and Sam debated the balance between using reference implementations in EIP documents, considering both their clarity benefits and potential review challenges. The meeting included EIP insights showing 5 new EIPs in draft, 4 in review, 1 moving to last call, 2 moving to final, and 2 moving to stagnant status, with Kjinder having completed more reviews than Akash this month.
