# Discuss ideas of blockchain projects (not crypto coins)

Hi everyone,

I am new to this forum, I have looked through this forum, Reddit and Discord communities and I have not found a thread to share and discuss ideas on expanding blockchain technology (of course, the Ether ecosystem is leading here …). I am not talking about new cryptocurrency projects, no. I will be happy to see a couple of large and important non-commercial information projects not related to cryptocurrencies, such as Wikipedia (this example only about non commercial and wide usage, not to copy the idea itself), etc.

I may be missing something, but I think that this discussion can strengthen the impact of the blockchain in general and the Etherium ecosystem separately in our new digital world.

Thank you.
