# I propose a standard that allows for a holding wallet address and a named owner

I propose a standard that allows for a holding wallet address and a named owner. This way an NFT could be held in trust, escrow or left in a will for the intended owner. I’m looking for someone to help me author this new standard if anyone is interested.
