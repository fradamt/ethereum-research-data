# Post-Quantum Signature Interop (aka PQ Interop) #01 | July 18, 2025

### 1. Opening & Context Setting

### 2. Team Proposals Presentation (20 minutes)

**Zeam Team Proposal** (20 minutes)

- Technical specifications (signatures, blockchain, networking)
- Success criteria and scaling plan
- Implementation timeline and milestones
- Q&A (5 minutes)

**Ream Team Proposal** (20 minutes)

- Devnet vs Testnet positioning
- Primary/secondary objectives
- Alternative technical approaches
- Implementation timeline
- Q&A (5 minutes)

### 3. Technical Alignment Discussion (10 minutes)

**Key Decision Points:**

- Validator count (1K vs 10K) and scaling approach
- Networking protocol (TCP vs QUIC, Gossipsub version)
- Consensus mechanism (Casper FFG vs no-consensus approach)
- Block structure (parent-child linking vs simplified)
- Success criteria and metrics

**Specification Dependencies:**

- Poseidon specification status and timeline
- PQ signature scheme parameters confirmation
- SSZ and encoding decisions

### 4. Multi-Client Coordination (10 minutes)
