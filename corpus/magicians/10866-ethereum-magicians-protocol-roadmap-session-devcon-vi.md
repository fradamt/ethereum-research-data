# Ethereum Magicians Protocol Roadmap Session @ Devcon VI

### Description

As [in Osaka](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/update-magicians-in-osaka-call-for-topics-ethereum-roadmap-2020/3653), Ethereum Magicians are organizing a community session to discuss Ethereum’s roadmap. We will first have a retrospective on The Merge, then spend the bulk of the session discussing potential protocol changes researchers, developers and community members are most excited about.

### Logistics

The session is scheduled on October 11, from 3-6pm local time, in the Workshop 1 — SLS/Community Room of Devcon Bogota. More information can be found [here](https://app.devcon.org/schedule/etjqdz).

Here’s a rough schedule of what you can expect:

- 15:00-15:10: Introduction

Overview of the session, explanation of ‘fishbowl’ and throw back to Osaka

15:10-16:00: Merge Retrospective

- Facilitated discussion with merge contributors about what went well, how we can improve for future upgrades, etc.

16:00-17:00: Discussion of [Surge/Verge/Purge/Splurge](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402)-related changes

- Fishbowl conversation about these various “large” roadmap items, and how client teams, researchers, and attendees in general think about their relative priorities

17:00-18:00: EIP Rapid Fire

- Short discussions about specific EIPs, with priority given to EIPs which have signalled they wish to be considered for Shanghai.

See you in Bogota ![:colombia:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/colombia.png?v=15) !

Hey Tehila, I would like to help with the translation of the notes for spanish speaking people. [@anett](/u/anett) [@timbeiko](/u/timbeiko) is this ok for EF? I have been doing this for almost every ACD Call since 3-4 months ago

**timbeiko** (2022-09-20):

Thanks for offering! To be clear, this session is aimed towards Core EIPs, but I personally would love to see a separate one focused on ERCs. The neat thing about Ethereum Magicians is that, like Ethereum, it’s permissionless! If you want to put together an ERC session during devcon, you can go ahead and do so ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12) In terms of space, AIUI, there is some coworking space during the venue, so you could use that.

Hi [@anett](/u/anett), my name is Marcus and I am a contributor at ENS DAO. I write the bi-weekly newsletter and have covered DAO wide updates since its inception. I will attend Devcon this year and will be assisting the ENS DAO at their booth.

Are you still looking for a note taker? I would be happy to do this for you and I can also translate the notes from English to Spanish. I am a Colombian National and am native/fluent in both languages.

I hope so, this will be able to boost everyone’s understanding, if Core EIPs are being addressed.
