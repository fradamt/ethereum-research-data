# NFT creators royalties protection mechanism

Recently, sudoAMM released the news that removing artist royalties.  AND no royalties has become a new profit trend. We began to think about how to protect the rights of creators, especially individual artists.

By the way, a16z has released can’t be evil licenses, NFT market may be more standardized and this provided some inspiration for our proposal.

We made a proposal aims to protect the rights of creators.

1. Distinguish the benefits that NFT can provide to buyers，decided which benefits needs to pay and which benefits are free to use.
2. Define the type of NFT
3. When a transaction occurs, a percentage fee will be charged if “need pay benefits” is included in this NFT .

Let us know what do you think about this idea pls! Feedback about the idea will also be appreciated  : )
