Can you update the permissions to “anyone with the link can view”?

Thanks!

Done. Sorry about this, permissions on mobile seem to be difficult, just getting back to a laptop now.

I don’t have permission to do this, but making this “owned” by [@jplatts12](/u/jplatts12) likely useful as well.

[@jplatts12](/u/jplatts12) own thread should be canonical [Lightning Talks: Web3 Tech Stack](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/lightning-talks-web3-tech-stack/726)

Should delete this topic.

No worries [@boris](/u/boris) and thank you!
