# Any interest in bringing back the Product Management Ring?

I’m a Web3 Product Manager who just stumbled upon this community. Doesn’t seem like there has been much action here since January 2019, which is crazy considering how much the Ethereum ecosystem has grown since then. Would love to kickstart this group again if anyone else is interested ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12)
