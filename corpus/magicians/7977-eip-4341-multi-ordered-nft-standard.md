# EIP-4341: Multi Ordered NFT Standard

Guys, thanks for the comments and feedbacks. [EIP-4341](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4341) has got merged. Here is the lastest abstract.

### Abstract

This standard introduces a smart contract interface that can represent a batch of non-fungible tokens of which the ordering information shall be retained and managed. Such information is particularly useful if `tokenId`s are encoded with the sets of `unicode`s for logographic characters and emojis. As a result, NFTs can be utilized as carriers of meanings.
