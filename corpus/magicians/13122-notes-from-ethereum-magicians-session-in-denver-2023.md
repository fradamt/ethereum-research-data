# Notes from Ethereum Magicians session in Denver 2023

I’m taking [notes in hackmd](https://hackmd.io/U83LYs7RTba56ZVZAYGKkA)

(They are messy, please help clean up…)

Thanks for sharing!

The entry barrier for new developers is definitely a big issue. Marketing voices are much louder than developer voices and that can steer the entire field off track. I wish I had a solution, but even if I did, I could not market it ![:no_mouth:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/no_mouth.png?v=12)
