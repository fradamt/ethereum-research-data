# Eth1 + Eth2 Merger Discussion

This is a critical community “Ethereum roadmap” discussion which has been the focus of several in-person discussions, including in 2018 Prague and 2019 Osaka.

The content below paraphrases [@djrtwo](/u/djrtwo)’s comments on the matter from his recent “[Eth2 quick update no 13](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/07/23/eth2-quick-update-no-13/)” blog post.

> I want to give a quick update on the eth1+eth2 merger progress and to give a huge shout-out to Mikhail (TXRX) and Guillaume (geth) for their excellent work.
>
>
> The current vision of the future of Ethereum is for the current chain to be integrated into the new eth2 consensus as a shard. This is the marriage of eth2 clients (consensus) with eth1 clients (highly optimized user layer) into a single system.
>

> The high level on the client relationship can be found here:
