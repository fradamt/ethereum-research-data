# Can my backend call a smart contract function to be executed on a certain date?

The architecture of my dapp consists of a backend (metamask + web3.js or web3.js + geth) and a smart contract that offers different services (functions). I want a function on the smart contract to run on a certain date. Can my backend call a smart contract function to be executed on a certain date? If it can, how?
