Hello magical family,

Interesting pathways, appreciate the opportunity to post. Not sure how relevant things are or may not be ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12) anymore. Sometimes it’s hard to decifer routes. I am however interested in learning how to add value here and open to any constructive criticism along the way.

[@jpitts](/u/jpitts), would you and the team please advise regarding Git or anything that may be of benefit. Thank you! Respectfully,
