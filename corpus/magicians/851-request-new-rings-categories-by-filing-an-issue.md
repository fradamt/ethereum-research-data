# Request new Rings / Categories by filing an issue

As people are creating new Rings, we’re getting questions on how to create sub categories under [#working-groups](/c/11-working-groups) or other forum stuff.

Please file an issue for this https://github.com/ethereum-magicians/scrolls/issues for now – [@jpitts](/u/jpitts) is the only one with permission at the moment, but if we start using issues this will I think help us scale that, as well as give a record of changes.

You can feel free to post here in [#site-feedback](/c/3-site-feedback) for broader discussion of issues too.
