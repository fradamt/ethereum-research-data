# Ethereum Magicians EPICs for 2019

The end of 2018 is near and triggered by this comment by [@pet3rpan](/u/pet3rpan)

I believe my 24/7 online internet presence along with my burning desire to clean[…]() up the issues backlog may potentially be an welcome spiritual addition to the hallways of the often-quiet and echoy halls of the scrolls repository.

Officially as of today, AEST Tuesday 4th of December: 1:04pm - Aye, Pet3rpan of house Ethereum would like to announce an formal expression of interest to become an interim github maintainer. This was enacted upon the comment of recommendation from none other than the dark and mysterious fellow known as @bmann.












I thought it makes sense to think about plans and direction of the Fellowship in 2019. I would really love to see moving away from github and discord to decentralized solutions like pando for dogfooding and decentralisation reasons.

What are your ideas for the fellowship in 2019?

is there any suggestions for decentralized googledocs?

Creating and maintaining document with tables, cross-links, TOCs is a nightmare in markdown. A decentralized wiki with a good visual editor would be great.
