# Mascot needed for Glamsterdam upgrade

A mascot is needed for Glamsterdam upgrade ([EIP-7773: Hardfork Meta - Glamsterdam](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7773)).

[EIP-8066: Upgrade Mascots](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-8066-upgrade-mascots/26009) specifies mascot requirements and role of facilitator (Mascot Wrestler).

[@EvilJordan](/u/eviljordan) proposed as Glamsterdam Mascot Wrestler

Recent upgrade names:

- Shapella (Shanghai + Capella)
- Dencun (Cancun + Deneb)
- Pectra (Prague + Electra)
- Fusaka (Fulu + Osaka)
- Glamsterdam (Gloas + Amsterdam)

See: [Post-Merge Network Upgrade Naming Schemes](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/rfc-post-merge-network-upgrade-naming-schemes/11977)

*(Apologies if I am stepping on the process for selecting star upgrade names, [I’m not a core dev](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1235979765879844864))*

Emojis from your emoji keyboard for animals, birds, nature, and weather. Select the emoji to learn its meaning, copy and paste the emoji, see its different...










| Mascot | Emoji | Reasoning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ant |  | Suggested because of ePBS, the headliner is all about building blocks, and ants are builders |
| Bee |  | Bees work hard: efficient, coordinated, and parallel. |
| Flamingo |  | Long & parallel legs: like how BALs will improve parallelisation.  Filter feeders (filter-like structure in their beak separate their prey): a bit like ePBS.  Collective noun is a flamboyance. What’s more glamorous than a flamboyance of flamingoes? |
| Lion |  |  |
| Poodle |  | Glamsterdam sounds elegant, poodle is a elegant dog. |

Ooo this is fun. I would suggest using a poodle! Emoji: ![:poodle:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/poodle.png?v=12) Reasoning: Glamsterdam sounds elegant, poodle is a elegant dog.

Fusaka bengal tiger btw, too. For balance after already having an African one with the Giraffe.

Dencun was blobfish, not blowfish.

**abcoathup** (2025-11-01):

[@etan-status](/u/etan-status) that is why we need [EIP-8066: Upgrade Mascots](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-8066-upgrade-mascots/26009) IMHO.

Blobfish couldn’t be represented by emoji (that I am aware of), which then meant there wasn’t an easy way to share on socials.  I used ![:blowfish:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/blowfish.png?v=12) for this purpose. .oO was the other alternative, but again not an emoji.

[@nixo](/u/nixo) took an Official™ emoji poll ![:grin:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=12) and ![:zebra:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/zebra.png?v=12) won out, but we still have ![:zebra:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/zebra.png?v=12) vs ![:tiger2:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/tiger2.png?v=12) for Fusaka less than a month out from mainnet.  A Mascot Wrestler could facilitate coordination.

  i forgot to screenshot but i took an Official™️ emoji poll in yesterday's All Core Devs Testing call to ask what Fusaka's mascot is

it's a zebra 🦓

**TrickyCrypto** (2025-12-09):

I vote for a Flamingo. ![:flamingo:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/flamingo.png?v=12) They are really glamorous and stand out with their pink, over the top feathers and long legs. Plus on the technical side:

- Flamingoes are known for their very long and parallel legs, much like how BALs will improve parallelisation.
- Flamingoes are filter feeders which use a filter-like structure in their beak separate their prey (brine shrimp and cyanobacteria among other creatures) from the water, a bit like proposer-builder separation.

Also, the collective noun for a group of flamingoes is a flamboyance… What’s more glamorous than a flamboyance of flamingoes? ![:flamingo:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/flamingo.png?v=12)![:flamingo:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/flamingo.png?v=12)![:flamingo:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/flamingo.png?v=12)![:flamingo:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/flamingo.png?v=12)

Imagine [@EvilJordan](/u/eviljordan) at the next conference in full mascot costume with a sign saying ask me about Glamsterdam.

Honestly, I love this. ![:flamingo:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/flamingo.png?v=12)![:mirror_ball:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/mirror_ball.png?v=12)

**EvilJordan** (2025-12-11):

Tonight, I went to a drive-through Holiday light show and saw this. I think it’s a sign.

I propose we use a Lion as [posted](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/lighthouse-trustless-payments.html) by lighthouse team.

---

**abcoathup** (2025-12-12):

[@bbusa](/u/bbusa) can you add some reasoning around why Lion should be chosen.  I couldn’t see anything in the Lighthouse article.

The post is a wikipost, so you should be able to edit.

---

**bbusa** (2025-12-12):

Look at the image they used for the article.

> Look at the image

[@bbusa](/u/bbusa) I don’t get how the Lion in the image represents Glamsterdam and/or PeerDAS & BALs?  I must be missing something.

**EvilJordan** (2025-12-15):

ANOTHER SIGN. IN FLASHING LIGHTS!

**louchi** (2025-12-15):

Flamingo is a good one. I was about suggest ![:pig:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/pig.png?v=12) Glamsterdam but ![:flamingo:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/flamingo.png?v=12) is much better. Both was pink, but one is nasty and the other glamour.

**anhdoanjp** (2025-12-19):

Flamingo is the one, cuz "What’s more **glam** orous than a flamboyance of flamingoes? ![:flamingo:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/flamingo.png?v=12) "
