Hi [@aktiontraction](/u/aktiontraction) thank you and congrats for your first EIP draft!

Have you checked the EIP repo and see if there are existing EIPs addressing similar issue? If so, can you provide your argument about whether

1. you could collaborate with existing EIP
2. you choose the create a competing EIP, which is also fine, but could you demonstrate merits of your EIP over the other one?

Thank you!
