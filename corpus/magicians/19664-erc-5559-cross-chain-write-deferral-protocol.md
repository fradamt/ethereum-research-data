# ERC-5559: Cross-chain Write Deferral Protocol

The following proposal is a superseding version of [EIP-5559: Cross-Chain Write Deferral Protocol](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-5559-cross-chain-write-deferral-protocol/10576), aka *CCIP-Write*, replacing Ethereum L1 storage with L2 chains and cryptographically secure databases with an aim to cut gas costs and further privacy while retaining the secure aspects of on-chain storage. Methods in this document specifically target security and cost-effectiveness of write deferrals in context of databases. The cross-chain data written with these methods can be retrieved by generic EIP-3668-compliant contracts completing the cross-chain data life cycle.

This proposal has been amended to a standalone ERC and discussions now exist at: [New ERC: Cross-chain Storage Router Protocol](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/new-erc-cross-chain-storage-router-protocol/19853)
