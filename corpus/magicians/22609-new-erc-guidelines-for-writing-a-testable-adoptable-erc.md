# New ERC: Guidelines for writing a testable, adoptable ERC

Hey all:

I wrote a little [Informational ERC](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/857/files) describing ways ERCs at the wallet and/or smart-contract level could be more testable, and ways for ERC authors to maximize the feedback they get from evaluators and implementers. I wrote this as a list of general pointers, but if you squint a little you might notice lots of it feels unrealistic today… but would be a lot less unrealistic if AllWalletDevs and AllERCDevs functioned a little more as a standing working group, maintained test suites that ERC authors could extend, etc etc.

Any comments necessary, and if any adhoc or informal Working Groups wanna dogfood this, I’d be thrilled!
