# Resulting from action item at wallet working group: ethereum-wallets/ethereum-wallet-list - please add your (favorite) wallets

please add your wallets here: https://github.com/ethereum-wallets/ethereum-wallet-list

also please let me know what fields you think are missing. Currently mainly focusing on the fields that I need for the android library that resolves wallets on given constraints.

Also searching people to champion the iOS and web side - currently focused on Android - but this also might make sense to have it for other platforms.
