# Why Ethereum gas price increased since Capella?

Hi guys,

I look at [this index](https://www.compassft.com/fr/indice/styeth-fr/) that represents the Ethereum stacking yield and it seems that since the Capella/Shanghai upgrade there is an increase in the stacking yield. Here, it means validators earn more from transaction fees than before the upgrade. I thought it was a miss computation, but when I look at other benchmarks like ultrasound.money or [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice), I can see the same cap before/after the upgrade for gas price.

My question is, what happened since Capella that increase the gas price ? Is that an huge climb of the network activity ? A new token like PEPE ? Or is this expand du to the upgrade itself ?

Thanks a lot guys ! ![:smiling_face:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/smiling_face.png?v=12)
