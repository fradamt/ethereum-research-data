Use the following paragraphs for a longer description, or to establish category guidelines or rules:

- Why should people use this category? What is it for?
- How exactly is this different than the other categories we already have?
- What should topics in this category generally contain?
- Do we need this category? Can we merge with another category, or subcategory?
