# Osaka devcon & Japan Blockchainweek

Would we like to have a new FEM gathering in Osaka?

Maybe as a part of Japan Blockchainweek (just an idea)?

Yes please! Japan Blockchain Week will consist of a list of events hosted around DevCon5. It would be a great way to get the local community involved. This will bring not only Ethereum enthusiasts and followers but the whole crypto community together and to learn about Ethereum ^^

FWIW, it would be very accommodating schedule-wise if this was the day right before Devcon (Monday Oct. 7th), as people could fly in over the weekend and just stay for the entire week.
