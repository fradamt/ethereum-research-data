# EIP-1872: Ethereum Network Upgrade Windows

Simple Summary:

A proposal to define a limited number of annual time windows in which network upgrades (aka hard forks) should be performed within. Policies for scheduling network upgrades outside these windows are also described.

Note: The selection of the third weeks of January, April, July, and October are a starting point and I am not set on those being the dates.  I am more interested in dates being defined.

Interesting! A regular “cadence” can be useful. Don’t think current levels of coordination could handle this many per year, but would force the whole system to get a bit tigher!

I think this is a good Berlin topic, where I definitely want to discuss ETH1x hardfork schedule.

We wouldn’t use every launch window.  They just constrain when a launch could occur.  Regular cadence would be 1-2 a year.
