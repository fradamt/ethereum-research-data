# IETFians to help guide FEM?

At the FEM Prague meeting, [@gregc](/u/gregc) mentioned how instead of the FEM joining IETF, some within the IETF wish they could be more like the FEM.

This seems an immense opportunity.  Can the FEMians ping their IETF contacts to chime in on their respective interests in the FEM—I’d like to hear from any of them what they think IETF can bring into the FEM.

On the FEM side, it would be a great win if we could get some long-term IETF handlers to assist in crafting/guiding the FEM policies and practices.
