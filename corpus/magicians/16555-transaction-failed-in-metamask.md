# Transaction failed in metamask

I need help to transact with my metamask, I sent a double transaction by mistake and now it has been stuck for the past 6 days, I can`t send or swap tokens anymore with my account, at first I keep getting "insufficient “gas” and when I am logging in again my metamask my account keeps showing this error message and I still can’t send any money out of my account
