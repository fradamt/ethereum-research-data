# Token Soulbound with recoverability

This EIP proposes a recoverability mechanism for Web3 companies to restore access to soulbound tokens (non-transferable tokens) in case of loss or security breaches of the original wallet. The mechanism will be applicable to ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 token standards.

**ogarciarevett** (2023-10-16):

The recoverability could be resolved using the ERC4337 AA, this post is deprecated.
