# Updating "Eth1" and "Eth2" categories, tags, etc. to "execution layer" "consensus layer"

This relates to recent changes proposed to naming conventions, generally that with the upcoming merge we label the layers after their purpose as opposed to series.

**Categories:**

Ethereum 1.x Ring → Execution Layer

(this topic is general and often involves execution layer research, perhaps it could be described w/ WG or Research?)

**Tags:**

eth2 → consensus-layer

eth1.x → execution-layer

eth1-eth2-merger → the-merge OR the-merge-2021

LGTM, doc with more context is available here: [The Great Renaming - HackMD](https://notes.ethereum.org/-8Gd4Nc8R1ObcwblcFZWXQ?both)

I’d favour “the-merge” over “the-merge-2021” ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9)
