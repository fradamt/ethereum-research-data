# Welcome to the Magic Forest

Here is the URL to follow: [Gather](https://gather.town/4Ip9lJfVy8QuRV7m/summer-sessions-2020)

Head over to the main hall to get to the Zoom call!

3 quick warnings:

- Mute yourself on Zoom if you’re also in the Gather / Magic Forest map
- Once you do the standard accept video/audio, you will start streaming once in proximity to others in the map
- You can re-spawn if something goes wrong, use the  settings to the left

This web application is the conference hall and social hangout for the [2020 Ethereum Magicians Summer Sessions](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-magicians-summer-sessions-claim-your-poap-nft/4421).

You can have audio/video discussions with anyone proximate to you in the Magic Forest map, so get there early to hang out before the Sessions at 3pm CET. There is also a text chat function.

Too bad I missed this magic gathering. How was your experience with the app? I’m considering to use it with my team.
