# Encypted communication for web3

In web3, we need a decentralized full link encrytion IM. I hope it’s a on chain solution by smart contract.

I want to make an ERC about it, with this, guys can communicate with any one by EOA address.

NO one can block it. it’s better solution than normal p2p comunication.

I have read EIP1, and konw that I need to first post a thread in the forum to review my idea, but I wonder how detailed to describe it.

I have read some similar proposals, like [EIP-2848](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2848), I think mine is a new idea.

Hope to get some suggestions.

Thanks in advance
