There hav been some interesting discussions, starting with Ameen Soleimani’s [“war mode” Tweet](https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1093671071734091777), and continuing today with Yalda Mousavinia’s [Enabling War Mode article](https://medium.com/@stellarmagnet/enabling-ethereum-war-mode-78ccc669299c).

Some points from Yalda’s article:

- Some centralization is necessary
- Coin holder vote for CEO / war general
- Avoid “Enterprise blockchain” because this enables our ecosystem competitors
- A key goal is to sustainably earn fiat, create fiat on-ramps
- As this is war, it is not necessary to practice open source or transparency

In the discussion so far, some interesting additional points are layered on:

- Decisions somehow need to be made swiftly (citing Horowitz’s Peacetime CEO / Wartime CEO)
- It is not necessary to avoid single sign-on e.g. FB Connect, so long as we have a roadmap to move users off of centralized platforms
- Product experiments, forking dapps but integrating using current “off the shelf” solutions e.g. Stripe

This increase in subscription revenue represents a major shift, and the community should take notice. Perhaps Apple has been strategically moving developer and user behavior away from “free + selling your data” over to “subscriptions + privacy”.
