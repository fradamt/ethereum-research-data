# Discussion about proposed Security Model for EVM Contracts (BeakerOS)

Hello, we’re currently working on an alternative security model and framework for smart contracts. Compared to existing alternatives such as AragonOS and Zeppelin it enforces permissions on-chain and can prevent privilege escalation at any point in the lifetime of a contract.

To read more please see our [website](https://beakeros.org) and [whitepaper](https://beakeros.org/docs/Whitepaper.pdf).

If anyone is interested, we’re looking to get help on both the EVM implementation and EWASM implementation. Our current work is done here: [repo link](https://github.com/daolab/beakeros).
