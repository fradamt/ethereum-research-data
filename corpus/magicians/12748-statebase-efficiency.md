# Statebase efficiency

Hi! I wrote an article about a scaling the EVM by rethinking and redesigning the world state database (the statebase, for short).

https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/evm-blockchain-scalability-acid-database-properties-a196b2200

In the article I discuss the relation between the statebase and database ACID properties. In the next article I’ll introduce FlatDB, my new statebase engine that does 20x read performance compared to LevelDB.
