According to "the internet" there is an ASIC based ethereum miner on the horizon.

[this *may* be the original source of that news](http://technews.cn/2018/02/12/bitmain-tsmc-dram/)

If you believe the analysis in the comments on [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/87ucsk/would_you_support_a_hard_fork_that_obsceletes_eth/) BitMain may already running these miners.

I believe it is the accepted wisdom that ASIC based mining leads to increases centralization when compared to GPU mining.

This leads us to two questions:

1. Should we hard fork to make ASIC mining harder and to demonstrate a willingness to hard fork any future ASIC based ethereum mining.
2. What specifically changes do we make to implement this increased ASIC resistance.

### Should we fork?

I propose that people indicate support/opposition with a simple 👍 / 👎  on this main issue.  I would prefer this conversation not devolve into deep discussions around this subjective topic so **my request is that people refrain from commenting on that specific question here**.

### How do we implement improved ASIC resistance

This is the primary issue that I think needs to be addressed, after which we can have an informed discussion about whether we should actually do it.
