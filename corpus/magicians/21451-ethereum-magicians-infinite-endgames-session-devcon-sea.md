[Once](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-magicians-protocol-roadmap-session-devcon-vi/10866/1) - [again](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/update-magicians-in-osaka-call-for-topics-ethereum-roadmap-2020/3653), Devcon will host Ethereum Magicians gatherings for the community to come together and discuss the most important topics in Ethereum’s roadmap.

This year’s theme is **Infinite Endgames**: an exploration of the tension between Ethereum’s organic evolution and the challenges of aligning on sustainable end states.

To wrap up the conference after a week of talks, workshops and hallway conversations, we’ll gather on November 15 from 10:00 - 16:00. The day will be broken down in four sessions:

- 10:00-11:15: Ethereum UX (notes & recording): exploring the challenges such as cross-L2 key management, asset handling and transactions; avoiding fragmentation (liquidity, network, users); coordinating standards across L2s and wallets; and more.
- Facilitator: @tomteman
- 11:30-12:45: Ethereum Execution (notes & recording):  discussing the evolution of Ethereum’s execution layer, L1 vs. L2, settlement vs. execution, enshrined rollups, consensus changes vs. client performance improvements, etc.

Facilitator: @matt

**13:00-14:15: Block Construction**:  covering PBS, MEV, role of validators vs. builders, centralization risks, and more!

- Facilitator: @ralexstokes

**14:30-16:00: Ethconomics ([notes & recording](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Breakout-Room-Meetings/DevconSEA/Ethconomics.md))**: debating the role of Ether in the network’s security, issuance proposals, out-of-protocol economic influences, and more!

- Facilitator: @timbeiko

Given the growing role of L2s in the ecosystem, how should ETH’s economic model evolve to ensure long-term network security?
