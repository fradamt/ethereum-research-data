# Notifying members of a ring and ring colors

#1 Is it possible to notify members of a ring - e.g. of an upcoming event/gathering/video call?

#2 Currently all rings have the same color (brown) - is it possible to assign colors to the different rings?

Would be happy with black or red or green for the wallet ring.

It’s a category not really a group. People can set preferences and “watch” a category in [their email preferences](/email_preferences) but that’s not really the same thing as being a member.

There IS a groups ability, too, but that would mean Ring Makers have to actively manage group membership. We may want to do that to show Wallet Ring members, AND you can @-mention groups which notifies all the users. This probably needs a tracking Github issue if we want to go this direction.

Yes, colours are possible.
