# ETH Prize: Transcribed Developer Interviews [84 in total]

Recently as part of the ETHPrize project, 84 developers from around the community were interviewed. These were conducted over several months by Rob Bent, Sina Habibian, Andy Tudhope, Josh Stark + individuals from L4, ECF, Web3 and the Ethereum Foundation. You can find their [original blog post here](https://medium.com/@cryptowanderer/ethprize-an-introduction-8fb60c7a0b7).

**The aim of the interviews looked to diagnose the biggest frustrations while trying to build dapps. The interview questions included:**

- What do you do?
- What are the tools/libraries/frameworks you use?
- What are your biggest frustrations?
- What tools don’t exist at the moment?
- How do you handle testing?
- What are the best educational resources?
- What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum?
- Are there any other questions we should be asking?

More recently, I have been helping organise the raw qualitative information from the different interviews into an excel sheet. Categorising the different insights from questions & answers. **Highly recommend that you dig through these if you have a 1-2 hours to spare.** Here is the excel sheet that is somewhat organised and digestible https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oj9VDHmhxPqQGKUAsISEnejdTnd-D5VAoRnVv2hDn6g/edit?usp=sharing // I am fairly slow with writing a summary for this but would love if someone else cold help / pick a section and summarise insights to share

This is apparently a small step towards a something bigger. You can find out more about the project here: https://discuss.status.im/t/datasets-by-status/76

**jpitts** (2018-06-17):

[@pet3rpan](/u/pet3rpan), this is great work, as are other efforts to acquire and process feedback such as the EIP-0 survey and Giveth’s ScalingNOW! interviews.

Understanding the needs and pain points of the various stakeholders is going to be critical to the success of the Ethereum platform. At the very least, this saves us from wasting time on initiatives and features that are not needed.
