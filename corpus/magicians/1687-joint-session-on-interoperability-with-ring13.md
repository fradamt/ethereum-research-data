# Joint session on interoperability with Ring13

[@boris](/u/boris),

Unfortunately, the Architects Ring (15) and the Ring 13 for EIPs & Interoperability are scheduled in the same time slot. The interoperability topic is a central for architects too, so I would propose to make a joint session at least on this topic, Further Ring specific topics could be discussed separately if needed.

[@apitkevich](/u/apitkevich), agree?

Hey [@Ethernian](/u/ethernian) — as I said in person I think there is enough to cover in the EIPs session to not merge. EIPs is not a ring, rather process oriented.

You’re welcome to bounce between sessions and there is lots to do post event to continue the discussion.

And if you could write more about your thoughts on interoperability that would be great.
