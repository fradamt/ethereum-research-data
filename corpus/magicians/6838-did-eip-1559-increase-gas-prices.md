# Did EIP-1559 increase gas prices?

Did anyone research preliminary effects of EIP-1559?

I am looking at etherscan, it seems to be lots of variance from one block to another - some blocks are heavy (over 20M gas), some really light.

Also, my impression is that gas prices did increase quite a bit on average …

This is a chart from Coindesk
