Mercy and Chase discussed the possibility of the meeting being canceled due to the cancellation of the AllCore dev testing call. Mercy confirmed that the meeting was still scheduled and would proceed as planned, even if some participants were absent. Chase expressed his understanding and support for moving forward with the meeting.

Zane presented an overview of the improved OpenRPC execution APIs repository, highlighting the switch to DocuSource for better documentation and development experience. He demonstrated features like in-repo documentation, searchable content, taggable methods, and customizable components. Zane also explained the process of configuring and deploying documents using DocuSource, emphasizing its flexibility and sustainability.

Mercy and Zane discussed the recent updates to the Gatsby project, which Zane confirmed was fully maintained and recently completed end-to-end. Zane clarified that the code changes were split into two commits, involving only four main files, despite the large number of lines in the commit log, which included generated markdown documents. Mercy expressed concern about the size of the codebase, and Zane explained that the changes were manageable and easy to verify.

Mercy and Simsonraj discussed the status of a project review. Mercy noted that most feedback was not actionable and suggested moving the review to the ACD meeting in January for more comprehensive review. Simsonraj, who had been traveling and out of office, agreed to wait for reviews before proceeding with any changes.

Mercy shared a link to a pull request for Ethereum’s execution-apis repository and requested feedback from the Erigon team. Simsonraj agreed to address some minor points before the next ACDC meeting. Zane mentioned improvements to the website’s usability and discussed the possibility of introducing the new website at the next ACDC meeting, which Mercy confirmed is scheduled for January 5th.

Mercy and Zane discussed monitoring issues and agreed to tag any related issues for follow-up. They scheduled the next meeting for January 12th and expressed hope for increased participation and improved call quality in the new year. The conversation ended with holiday wishes from all participants.

### Next Steps:

- Erigon team : Review the error code categories proposal and provide feedback
- Simsonraj: Address minor actionable feedback points raised in the thread before the next ACDC meeting
- Mercy: Tag the execution APIs update to the ACDC issue when it’s created for January 5th meeting
- Mercy: Present the new website improvements at the next ACDE/Designation layer call
- Zane: Keep an eye out for the January 5th ACDC meeting
