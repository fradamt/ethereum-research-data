# Context Linking Token

Magicians one and all,

I’m exploring an application of ethereum tokens to track the ***context*** of any dataset, or document/file, or news article, personal information etc.

I’ve written a short article to explain my thinking here:

[medium.com/codex/context-linking-tokens](https://medium.com/codex/context-linking-tokens-81203766e0f1)

Would any of you be able to give me some feedback on whether you think this idea has merit, and/or if there are any pitfalls I should consider before I make a formal EIP application.

Many thanks!
