# Krypton - P2P solution for accessing mobile wallets from desktop applications

Krypton is an open-source solution for allowing DApps to have a “wallet connection” but instead of relying on a 3rd party for the whole communication it uses libp2p and WebRTC to have the Wallet connect directly to the DApp.

There is a basic “protocol” for getting identities, exchanging metadata about both peers and requesting a signature which could really become a community EIP for methods that a wallet should support for an open standard.

Please feel free to give any feedback you have and contributions are more than welcome ![:slight_smile:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12)
