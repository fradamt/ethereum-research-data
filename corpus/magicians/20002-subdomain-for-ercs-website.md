# Subdomain for ERCs website?

ERCs have recently been extracted out of the EIPs repository, and moved to a separate repo:

https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs

But from what I can tell, ERCs are still hosted on the same website:



      [Ethereum Improvement Proposals](https://eips.ethereum.org/)





###



Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) describe standards for the Ethereum platform, such as core protocol specifications.










Are there any plans to create an [ercs.ethereum.org](http://ercs.ethereum.org) subdomain?

ERC subdomain just has ERCs.  Don’t know if there are further plans.
