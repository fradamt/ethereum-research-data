# ERC-7765: Privileged Non-Fungible Tokens Tied To RWA

Here is my PR:

https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/pull/624

This EIP defines an interface to carry a real world asset with some privileges that can be exercised by the holder of the corresponding NFT. The EIP standardizes the interface for non-fungible tokens representing real world assets with privileges to be exercised, such as products sold onchain which can be redeemed in the real world.
