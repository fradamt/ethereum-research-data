# EOFv2 aka what "EVM 2.0" could look like

We have been thinking about the a number of proposals which have been made for EOF (most notable around account introspection) and summarised our thoughts in this document:

# EOFv2  [toc]  ## Background  The EVM Object Format (EOF) was proposed as a number of separate EIPs










This gives our view on the roadmap of EOF (v1, and v2 – the final boss ![:grin:](https://ethereum-magicians.org/images/emoji/twitter/grin.png?v=15)).

**axic** (2023-03-24):

Over the past few months this work has evolved in multiple stages:

1. A longer document describing various options: EOFv2 Design Space - HackMD
2. A two-staged rollout plan: EOFv1.1 aka EOF rollout Cancun+Prague - HackMD
3. And now a unified specification covering “EOFv2”: "Mega EOF Endgame" Specification - HackMD

There’s more discussion on this at: [EVM Object Format (EOF)](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/evm-object-format-eof/5727)
