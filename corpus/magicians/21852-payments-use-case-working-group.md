# Payments Use Case Working Group

# Problem

No blockchain ecosystem has yet nailed the **customer-to-merchant payments use case**. Mainstream users still do not pay with crypto, and they are not close to doing so.

# Opportunity

Ethereum is the perfect ecosystem to redesign this use case and grow to Visa and Mastercard levels of adoption.

# Goal

In other words, the KPI is that most of our friends use Ethereum-powered methods in their everyday lives. Customer-to-merchant payments will bring the first billion users to Ethereum.

# More Info

Payments is a complex social and technical problem. It requires specific coordination among the players on the ecosystem to unlock network effects.
