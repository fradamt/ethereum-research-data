# Proposal: reprint stickers

At the gathering in Berlin before ETHBerlin and at ETHBerlin I distributed the iron reserve of the stickers from 2018. I propose to us some funds from Ethereum Magicians to reprint these stickers. Find context here: [Ethereum Magician Stickers](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-magician-stickers/1839)

Here is how it looks:

Would like to print ~1k - ~10k of them - IMHO they are timeless and the more one prints the cheaper they get.
