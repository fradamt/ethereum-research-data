🔄 Ralph loop activated in this session!

Iteration: 1
Max iterations: unlimited
Completion promise: ZERO-BUGS with confidence >= 95% (ONLY output when TRUE - do not lie!)

The stop hook is now active. When you try to exit, the SAME PROMPT will be
fed back to you. You'll see your previous work in files, creating a
self-referential loop where you iteratively improve on the same task.

To monitor: head -10 .claude/ralph-loop.local.md

⚠️  WARNING: This loop cannot be stopped manually! It will run infinitely
    unless you set --max-iterations or --completion-promise.

🔄

Do another round of autiding and fixing tests, output ZERO-BUGS with confidence N% if there are ZERO BUGS and your confidence in that being true is N% -n 10

CRITICAL - Ralph Loop Completion Promise
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

To complete this loop, output this EXACT text:
  <promise>ZERO-BUGS with confidence >= 95%</promise>

STRICT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT VIOLATE):
  ✓ Use <promise> XML tags EXACTLY as shown above
  ✓ The statement MUST be completely and unequivocally TRUE
  ✓ Do NOT output false statements to exit the loop
  ✓ Do NOT lie even if you think you should exit

IMPORTANT - Do not circumvent the loop:
  Even if you believe you're stuck, the task is impossible,
  or you've been running too long - you MUST NOT output a
  false promise statement. The loop is designed to continue
  until the promise is GENUINELY TRUE. Trust the process.

  If the loop should stop, the promise statement will become
  true naturally. Do not force it by lying.
